S'BankAmerica Corp is not under\npressure to act quickly on its propos'
p814
aS'ed equity offering and\nwould do well to delay it because of the sto'

aS'"ck\'s recent poor\nperformance, banking analysts said.\n    Some anal"'
p816

p817
aS'lion-dlr equity offering, which has yet to be\napproved by the Secur'
p818
aS'ities and Exchange Commission.\n    BankAmerica stock fell this week'
p819
aS', along with other banking\nissues, on the news that Brazil has susp'
p820
aS'ended interest payments\non a large portion of its foreign debt.'
p821
aS'The stock traded around 12, down 1/8, this afternoon,\nafter falli'
p822
aS'ng to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news.\n    Banking analysts sa'
p823
aS'id that with the immediate threat of the\nFirst Interstate Bancorp <'
p824
aS'I> takeover bid gone, BankAmerica is\nunder no pressure to sell the'
p825
aS'securities into a market that\nwill be nervous on bank stocks in the'
p826
aS'near term.\n    BankAmerica filed the offer on January 26. It was s'
p827
aS'een as\none of the major factors leading the First Interstate\nwithd'
p828
aS'rawing its takeover bid on February 9.\n    A BankAmerica spokesman'
p829
aS'said SEC approval is taking longer\nthan expected and market conditi'
p830
aS'ons must now be re-evaluated.\n    "The circumstances at the time wi'
p831
aS'll determine what we do,"\nsaid Arthur Miller, BankAmerica\\\'s Vice P'
p832
aS'resident for Financial\nCommunications, when asked if BankAmerica wo'
p833
aS'uld proceed with\nthe offer immediately after it receives SEC approv'
p834
aS'al.\n    "I\\\'d put it off as long as they conceivably could," said'
p835
aS'Lawrence Cohn, analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and\nSmith'
p836
aS'.\n    Cohn said the longer BankAmerica waits, the longer they\nhave'
p837
aS'to show the market an improved financial outlook.\n    Although Ban'
p838
aS'kAmerica has yet to specify the types of\nequities it would offer, m'
p839
aS'ost analysts believed a convertible\npreferred stock would encompass'
p840
aS'at least part of it.\n    Such an offering at a depressed stock pri'
p841
aS'ce would mean a\nlower conversion price and more dilution to BankAme'
p842
aS'rica stock\nholders, noted Daniel Williams, analyst with Sutro Group'
p843
aS'.\n    Several analysts said that while they believe the Brazilian'
p844
aS'debt problem will continue to hang over the banking industry\nthroug'
p845
aS'h the quarter, the initial shock reaction is likely to\nease over th'
p846
aS'e coming weeks.\n    Nevertheless, BankAmerica, which holds about 2.'
p847
aS'70 billion\ndlrs in Brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs i'
p848
aS'f the\ninterest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mln'
p849
aS'dlrs if Brazil pays no interest for a year, said Joseph\nArsenio, an'
p850
aS'alyst with Birr, Wilson and Co.\n    He noted, however, that any pot'
p851
aS'ential losses would not show\nup in the current quarter.\n    With o'
p852
aS'ther major banks standing to lose even more than\nBankAmerica if Bra'
p853
aS'zil fails to service its debt, the analysts\nsaid they expect the de'
p854
aS'"bt will be restructured, similar to way\nMexico\'s debt was, minimizi"'

aS'ly this fall, president\nPierre Peladeau told Reuters in an intervie'

p3886
aS'Quebecor, which had revenues of 446 mln Canadian dlrs last\nyear'

aS'making the city\nthe most crowded metropolitan newspaper market in N'

p3893
aS'have indicated a new English\nlanguage tabloid would have circulati'
p3894
aS'on of 50,000 within six\nmonths. He said he is waiting to determine'
p3895
aS'whether the new\nventure would have the support of major advertisers'
p3896
aS'.\n    Peladeau, who together with family members owns about 55\npct'
p3897
aS'of Quebecor, said he has recieved offers from the heads of\ntwo maj'
p3898
aS'or Canadian companies who are interested in the project\nbut has not'
p3899
aS'decided whether he would take partners in the\nnewspaper venture.'
p3900
aS'He said he would consider launching the newspaper with one\nof t'

aS'the possibility of doing something else in the\nshort term," Pelade'

S'U.S. bank discount window borrowings\nless extended credits averaged'
p5299
aS'310 mln dlrs in the week to\nWednesday February 25, the Federal Res'
p5300
aS'erve said.\n    The Fed said that overall borrowings in the week fel'
p5301
aS'l 131\nmln dlrs to 614 mln dlrs, with extended credits up 10 mln dlr'
p5302
aS's\nat 304 mln dlrs. The week was the second half of a two-week\nstat'
p5303
aS'ement period. Net borrowings in the prior week averaged 451\nmln dlr'
p5304
aS's.\n    Commenting on the two-week statement period ended February'
p5305
aS'25, the Fed said that banks had average net free reserves of\n644 ml'
p5306
aS'n dlrs a day, down from 1.34 billion two weeks earlier.\n    A Feder'
p5307
aS'al Reserve spokesman told a press briefing that\nthere were no large'
p5308
aS'" single day net misses in the Fed\'s reserve\nprojections in the week"'
p5309
aS'to Wednesday.\n    He said that natural float had been "acting a bi'
p5310
aS't\nstrangely" for this time of year, noting that there had been\npoo'
p5311
aS'r weather during the latest week.\n    The spokesman said that natur'
p5312
aS'al float ranged from under 500\nmln dlrs on Friday, for which he cou'
p5313
aS'ld give no reason, to\nnearly one billion dlrs on both Thursday and'
p5314
aS'"Wednesday.\n    The Fed spokeman could give no reason for Thursday\'s"'
p5315
aS'" high\nfloat, but he said that about 750 mln dlrs of Wednesday\'s\nfl"'
p5316
aS'oat figure was due to holdover and transportation float at\ntwo wide'
p5317
aS'ly separated Fed districts.\n    For the week as a whole, he said th'
p5318
aS'at float related as of\nadjustments were "small," adding that they f'
p5319
aS'ell to a negative\n750 mln dlrs on Tuesday due to a number of correc'
p5320
aS'tions for\nunrelated cash letter errors in six districts around the'
p5321
aS'country.\n    The spokesman said that on both Tuesday and Wednesday,'
p5322
aS'two\ndifferent clearing banks had system problems and the securitie'
p5323
aS's\nand Federal funds wires had to be held open until about 2000 or'
p5324
aS'2100 EST on both days.\n    However, he said that both problems were'
p5325
aS'cleared up during\nboth afternoons and there was no evidence of any'
p5326
aS'reserve\nimpact.\n    During the week ended Wednesday, 45 pct of ne'

p5328
aS'30 pct\nby the 14 large money center banks and 25 pct by large regio'

S'American Express Co remained silent on\nmarket rumors it would spino'
p5378
aS'ff all or part of its Shearson\nLehman Brothers Inc, but some analys'
p5379
aS'ts said the company may be\nconsidering such a move because it is un'
p5380
aS'happy with the market\nvalue of its stock.\n    American Express sto'
p5381
aS'ck got a lift from the rumor, as the\nmarket calculated a partially'
p5382
aS'public Shearson may command a\ngood market value, thereby boosting t'
p5383
aS'he total value of American\nExpress. The rumor also was accompanied'
p5384
aS'by talk the financial\nservices firm would split its stock and boost'
p5385
aS'its dividend.\n    American Express closed on the New York Stock Ex'
p5386
aS'change at\n72-5/8, up 4-1/8 on heavy volume.\n    American Express w'
p5387
aS'ould not comment on the rumors or its\nstock activity.\n    Analysts'
p5388
aS'" said comments by the company at an analysts\'\nmeeting Tuesday helpe"'
p5389
aS'd fuel the rumors as did an announcement\nyesterday of management ch'
p5390
aS'anges.\n    At the meeting, company officials said American Express'
p5391
aS'stock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance\nof'
p5392
aS'Shearson, according to analysts.\n    Yesterday, Shearson said it wa'
p5393
aS's elevating its chief\noperating officer, Jeffery Lane, to the added'
p5394
aS'position of\npresident, which had been vacant. It also created four'
p5395
aS'new\npositions for chairmen of its operating divisions.\n    Analys'
p5396
aS'ts speculated a partial spinoff would make most\nsense, contrary to'
p5397
aS'one variation on market rumors of a total\nspinoff.\n    Some analys'
p5398
aS'ts, however, disagreed that any spinoff of\nShearson would be good s'
p5399
aS'ince it is a strong profit center for\nAmerican Express, contributin'
p5400
aS'g about 20 pct of earnings last\nyear.\n    "I think it is highly un'
p5401
aS'likely that American Express is\ngoing to sell shearson," said Perri'
p5402
aS'n Long of Lipper Analytical.\nHe questioned what would be a better i'
p5403
aS'nvestment than "a very\nprofitable securities firm."\n    Several an'
p5404
aS'alysts said American Express is not in need of\ncash, which might be'
p5405
aS'the only reason to sell a part of a strong\nasset.\n    But others'
p5406
aS'believe the company could very well of\nconsidered the option of spi'
p5407
aS'nning out part of Shearson, and one\nrumor suggests selling about 20'
p5408
aS'pct of it in the market.\n    Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache'
p5409
aS'Securities said he\nbelieves American Express could have considered'
p5410
aS'a partial\nspinoff in the past.\n    "Shearson being as profitable'
p5411
aS'as it is would have fetched a\nbig premium in the market place. Shea'
p5412
aS'"rson\'s book value is in\nthe 1.4 mln dlr range. Shearson in the mark"'
p5413
aS'et place would\nprobably be worth three to 3.5 bilion dlrs in terms'
p5414
aS'of market\ncapitalization," said Eckenfelder.\n    Some analysts sai'
p5415
aS'd American Express could use capital since\nit plans to expand globa'
p5416
aS'lly.\n    "They have enormous internal growth plans that takes\ncapi'
p5417
aS'tal. You want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to\nenhance'
p5418
aS'your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the\nroad," said E'
p5419
aS'.F. Hutton Group analyst Michael Lewis.\n    "They\\\'ve outlined the'
p5420
aS'"fact that they\'re investing heavily\nin the future, which goes heavi"'
p5421
aS'ly into the international\narena," said Lewis. "...That does not pre'
p5422
aS'clude acquisitions and\ndivestitures along the way," he said.\n    L'
p5423
aS'ewis said if American Express reduced its exposure to the\nbrokerage'
p5424
aS'business by selling part of shearson, its stock might\nbetter refle'
p5425
aS'ct other assets, such as the travel related\nservices business.'
p5426
aS'"It could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure\nto broke'

p5428
aS'iple because they constitute a higher percentage of\nthe total opera'

S'A study on grain certificates due out\nshortly from the Government A'
p6567
aS'ccounting Office (GAO) could show\nthat certificates cost the govern'
p6568
aS'ment 10 to 15 pct more than\ncash outlays, administration and indust'
p6569
aS'ry sources said.\n    Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the Ag'
p6570
aS'riculture\nDepartment and the Office of Management and Budget sugges'
p6571
aS'ts\nthat certificates cost more than cash payments, a GAO official'
p6572
aS'told Reuters.\n    GAO is preparing the certificate study at the spe'
p6573
aS'cific\nrequest of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), former chairman of the'
p6574
aS'senate agriculture committee.\n    The report, which will focus on t'
p6575
aS'he cost of certificates\ncompared to cash, is scheduled to be releas'
p6576
aS'ed in mid March.\n    The cost of certificates, said the GAO source,'
p6577
aS'" depends on\nthe program\'s impact on the USDA loan program.\n    If "'
p6578
aS'GAO determines that certificates encourage more loan\nentries or cau'
p6579
aS'se more loan forfeitures, then the net cost of\nthe program would go'
p6580
aS'up. However, if it is determined that\ncertificates have caused the'
p6581
aS'government grain stockpile to\ndecrease, the cost effect of certifi'
p6582
aS'cates would be less.\n    GAO will not likely suggest whether the ce'
p6583
aS'rtificates\nprogram should be slowed or expanded, the GAO official s'
p6584
aS'aid.\n    But a negative report on certificates "will fuel the fire'
p6585
aS'against certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase\nin t'
p6586
aS'he certificate program," an agricultural consultant said.\n    The O'
p6587
aS'MB is said to be against any expansion of the program,\nwhile USDA r'

aS'ress its production cutting\nagreement if the organization wants to'
p6968
aS'halt the current slide\nin oil prices, oil industry analysts said.'
p6969
aS'"The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy\nas O'

p6972
aS'ssociates, CERA.\n    Analysts and oil industry sources said the pro'

aS'blem OPEC\nfaces is excess oil supply in world oil markets.\n    "OP'
p6974
aS'"EC\'s problem is not a price problem but a production\nissue and must"'
p6975
aS'be addressed in that way," said Paul Mlotok, oil\nanalyst with Salo'

p6979
aS'f\nit wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices.\n    But some o'
p6980
aS'ther analysts were uncertain that even an\nemergency meeting would a'
p6981
aS'ddress the problem of OPEC production\nabove the 15.8 mln bpd quota'
p6982
aS'set last December.\n    "OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market y'
p6983
aS'ou cannot have\ndeemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials,"'
p6984
aS'said the\nregional manager for one of the major oil companies who sp'
p6985
aS'oke\non condition that he not be named. "The market is now trying to'
p6986
aS'teach them that lesson again," he added.\n    David T. Mizrahi, ed'
p6987
aS'itor of Mideast reports, expects OPEC\nto meet before June, although'
p6988
aS'not immediately. However, he is\nnot optimistic that OPEC can addre'
p6989
aS'ss its principal problems.\n    "They will not meet now as they try'
p6990
aS'to take advantage of the\nwinter demand to sell their oil, but in la'
p6991
aS'te March and April\nwhen demand slackens," Mizrahi said.\n    But Mi'
p6992
aS'zrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more\nthan reiterate'
p6993
aS'its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd."\n    Analysts said t'
p6994
aS'"hat the next two months will be critical for\nOPEC\'s ability to hold"'
p6995
aS'together prices and output.\n    "OPEC must hold to its pact for th'
p6996

p8510
aS'id.\n    Under the 1985 Farm credit law passed by Congress, the FCA,'

p8514
aS'is tied-up in legal action,\nhe could not technically certify a res'

aS'cue is needed this year\nand perhaps not even in 1988. The other Rep'
p8516
aS'ublican member of\nthe three-man FCA board, Marvin Duncan, agreed.'
p8517
aS'But Boren urged that even if FCA cannot technically certify\naid'
p8518
aS'is needed, it should request help informally.\n    "We all know we'
p8519
aS'need a capital infusion," Boren said.\n    Boren and the FCA officia'
p8520
aS'ls spoke at a hearing on the\nplight of the farm credit system. Also'
p8521
aS'at the hearing, Brent\nBeesely, chief executive of the Farm Credit'
p8522
aS'Council\nrepresenting the system, said that at the end of 1986 the'
p8523
aS'system had only 1.5 billion dlrs in working capital remaining\nafter'
p8524
aS'losses of 4.6 billion dlrs over the last two years.\n    While he d'
p8525
aS'id not ask for government aid, Beesley indicated\nthe situation is s'
p8526
aS'erious in some of the 12 system districts.\n    "A significant numbe'
p8527
aS'r of banks and associations in the most\neconomically depressed area'
p8528
aS's have and will continue to suffer\nextraordinary losses," Beesley s'
p8529
aS'aid.\n    Jim Billington, Democratic member of the FCA board, said'
p8530
aS'the troubles of the system have encouraged the flight of some\none b'
p8531
aS'illion dlrs per month from the system as borrowers repay\nloans.'
p8532
aS'"  The system\'s total portfolio shrank to 54.6 billion dlrs by\nthe e"'
p8533
aS'nd of last year from 66.6 billion the previous year.\n    FCA board'
p8534
aS'members said both borrowers and holders of bonds\nin the system need'
p8535
aS'to be assured their money is safe. Naylor\nsuggested the need for a'
p8536
aS'federal assurance to bondholders.\n    "The bondholders have no wor'
p8537
aS'ry at this time," Billington\nsaid.\n    Naylor said several proposa'
p8538
aS'ls for revamping the farm credit\nsystem are circulating. The propos'
p8539
aS'als range from consolidation\nof the system into a centralized natio'
p8540
aS'nal lender, to\nde-centralizing into semi-independent institutions.'
p8541
aS'But He and the system spokesman Beesley were cautious about\npro'
p8542
aS'posals for a secondary market on farm loans. Those\nproposals would'
p8543
aS'package farm loans for resale to investors.\n    Naylor and Beesley'
p8544
aS'said a secondary market set-up outside\nthe farm credit system would'
p8545
aS'hurt the system. But Beesley said\na secondary market with the farm'

S'The sharp decline in soybean crush ratios\nseen in the last few week'
p9751
aS's, accelerating in recent days, has\npushed margins below the cost o'
p9752
aS'f production at most soybean\nprocessing plants and prompted many to'
p9753
aS'cut output of soybean\nmeal and oil.\n    The weekly U.S. soybean c'
p9754
aS'rush rate was reported by the\nNational Soybean Processors Associati'
p9755
aS'on this afternoon at 21.78\nmln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel'
p9756
aS'plus rate seen over\nthe past two months when crush margins surged'
p9757
aS'to the best\nlevels seen in over a year.\n    Active soymeal export'
p9758
aS'loadings at the Gulf had pushed\nsoybean futures and premiums higher'
p9759
aS', prompting a pick-up in the\nweekly crush number.\n    However, muc'
p9760
aS'h of that export demand seems to have been met,\nwith most foreign m'

p9765
aS'steadily dropped offering prices in\nan attempt to find buying inte'
p9766
aS'rest, soyproduct dealers said.\n    Soybean meal futures have also s'
p9767
aS'teadily declined in recent\nweeks, setting a new contract low of 139'
p9768
aS'.70 dlrs per ton in the\nnearby March contract today.\n    "Many spe'
p9769
aS'culators down here bought March soymeal and sold\nMay, looking for n'
p9770
aS'o deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow,\nwhich would cause March'
p9771

p9773
aS'e there will be a lot delivered, if not\ntomorrow, then later in the'

aS'March crush\nratio (The value of soyproducts less the cost of the so'

aS'bushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last two\ndays.'
p9778
aS'The May crush ended today just over 17 cents, so no\nprocessors'
p9779
aS'will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable\nlevel, the trader'
p9780
aS'said. Hopefully, they will now start to cut\nback production to get'
p9781
aS'supplies in line with demand, he added.\n    With futures down, pro'

aS'cessors are finding they must bid\npremiums for cash soybeans, furth'

S'The major U.S. Government bond brokers\nare likely to give in to pre'

p33166
aS'ng their direct-dealing screens\navailable to many of those firms th'
p33167
aS'at are not now eligible to\nreceive them, said Richard Lacy, Chairma'
p33168
aS'n of Exco International\nInc.\n    Earlier today, Exco said it purch'
p33169
aS'ased an 80 pct interest in\nRMJ Holdings Corp, one of the largest of'
p33170
aS'the four bond brokers\nthat dominate the business.\n    In a teleph'
p33171
aS'one interview, Lacy said "Within 18 months, we\nthink the number of'
p33172
aS'players will be expanded."\n    Currently, the four major brokers wi'
p33173
aS'll sell their\ndirect-dealing screens to only primary dealers in U.S'
p33174
aS'.\nGovernment securities or those that have applied to the Federal'
p33175
aS'Reserve Bank of New york to become a primary dealer.\n    The U.S. J'
p33176
aS'ustice department is looking into whether\nlimiting access to the sc'
p33177
aS'reens to just a small group of dealers\nis a violation of U.S. Anti-'
p33178
aS'trust laws.\n    Primary dealers, of which there are now 40, are an'
p33179
aS'elite\ngroup of firms approved to buy Treasury securities directly'
p33180
aS'from the Fed.\n    But Lacy said that any agreement to expand access'
p33181
aS'" to the\nbrokers\' direct-dealing screens is likely to be not as\nfar"'
p33182
aS'-reaching as some would like. Instead of making screens\navailable t'
p33183
aS'o any firm willing to pay for one, he said, it is\nmore likely that'
p33184
aS'a "second tier" will be established.\n    He also said that RMJ is n'
p33185
aS'ot willing to break away from the\ngroup of bond brokers and be the'
p33186
aS'only firm to make its screens\nwidely available to any one who wants'
p33187
aS'them.\n    Bond market sources had speculated that RMJ is better\np'
p33188
aS'repared to offer its services nationwide than its three major\ncompe'
p33189
aS'titors.\n    Lacy also said that he does not see any immediate press'
p33190
aS'ure\nfor a further cut in commissions paid on bond transactions any'
p33191
aS'time soon. In late 1985, transaction fees paid to brokers were\ncut'
p33192
aS'in half to 39 dlrs per mln dlr transaction from 78 dlrs.\n    Some U'
p33193
aS'.S. primary bond dealers have been suggesting that\nwith further inc'
p33194

S'The New York Mercantile Exchange set\nApril one for the debut of a n'
p34666
aS'ew procedure in the energy\ncomplex that will increase the use of en'
p34667
aS'ergy futures worldwide.\n     On April one, NYMEX will allow oil tra'
p34668
aS'ders that do not\nhold a futures position to initiate, after the exc'
p34669
aS'hange closes,\na transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the'
p34670
aS'futures\nmarket, according to an exchange spokeswoman.\n    "This wi'
p34671
aS'll change the way oil is transacted in the real\nworld," said said T'
p34672
aS'homas McKiernan, McKiernan and Co chairman.\n    Foreign traders wil'
p34673
aS'l be able to hedge trades against NYMEX\nprices before the exchange'
p34674
aS'opens and negotiate prices at a\ndifferential to NYMEX prices, McKie'
p34675
aS'rnan explained.\n     The expanded program "will serve the industry'
p34676
aS'because the\noil market does not close when NYMEX does," said Frank'
p34677
aS'Capozza,\nsecretary of Century Resources Inc.\n     The rule change,'
p34678
aS'which has already taken effect for\nplatinum futures on NYMEX, is e'
p34679
aS'xpected to increase the open\ninterest and liquidity in U.S. energy'
p34680
aS'futures, according to\ntraders and analysts.\n    Currently, at leas'
p34681
aS't one trader in this transaction, called\nan exchange for physical o'
p34682
aS'r EFP, must hold a futures position\nbefore entering into the transa'
p34683
aS'ction.\n    Under the new arrangement, neither party has to hold a'
p34684
aS'futures position before entering into an EFP and one or both\npartie'
p34685
aS's can offset their cash transaction with a futures\ncontract the nex'
p34686
aS't day, according to exchange officials.\n    When NYMEX announced it'
p34687
aS's proposed rule change in December,\nNYMEX President Rosemary McFadd'
p34688
aS'en, said, "Expansion of the EFP\nprovision will add to globalization'
p34689

aS'entertainment companies, pitted a\nmanagement group and other inves'
p35126
aS'tors against National\nAmusements Inc, a closely held theater operat'
p35127
aS'or.\n    Both sides raised their bids over the weekend. A source\ncl'
p35128
aS'ose to the management side insisted that timing was on his\nside. He'
p35129
aS'said if outside directors approve the management\nproposal, a merge'

p35131
aS'oing out late this week. "It would take 20\ndays from the day we mai'

p35133
aS'controlled by\ninvestor Sumner Redstone, would need "half a year" to'
p35134
aS'complete\na tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that m'

p35137

p35138
aS'rare\nsituation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war. On'

aS'e\nsaid Redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted and'
p35140
aS'if enough people were convinced his proposal was superior to\nthe Vi'
p35141
aS'acom management plan, he would have a chance to win.\n    The indepe'
p35142
aS'ndent directors of Viacom were called into a\nmeeting today. Word on'
p35143
aS'a decision was expected early tomorrow.\n    Viacom shares climbed'
p35144
aS'2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon. One\nmajor Wall Street firm issued'
p35145
aS'a sell recommendation. "We think\nwe\\\'re at the end now, in terms of'

aS'"not be identified.\n    Both Redstone\'s proposal and the management "'
p35148
aS'proposal would\ncreate a restructured company heavily leveraged with'

p35159
aS'worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share of\nconvertible preferred. Th'
