S'Showers continued throughout the week in the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early January and improving prospects for the coming temporao, although normal humidity levels have not been restored, Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review.     The dry period means the temporao will be late this year.     Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93 mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures.     Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers, middlemen, exporters and processors.     There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.     In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.     Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.     Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to 1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.     New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs per tonne FOB.     Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at 4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs.     April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at 2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and 2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.     Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas, Uruguay and open ports.     Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times New York Dec for Oct/Dec.     Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible currency areas.     Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2,325 and 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.     Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags against the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88 crop.     Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to be published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after carnival which ends midday on February 27.  Reuter \\x03'

S'BankAmerica Corp is not under pressure to act quickly on its proposed equity offering and would do well to delay it because of the sto"ck\'s recent poor performance, banking analysts said.     Some anal"ysts said they have recommended BankAmerica delay its up to one-billion-dlr equity offering, which has yet to be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.     BankAmerica stock fell this week, along with other banking issues, on the news that Brazil has suspended interest payments on a large portion of its foreign debt.     The stock traded around 12, down 1/8, this afternoon, after falling to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news.     Banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of the First Interstate Bancorp <I> takeover bid gone, BankAmerica is under no pressure to sell the securities into a market that will be nervous on bank stocks in the near term.     BankAmerica filed the offer on January 26. It was seen as one of the major factors leading the First Interstate withdrawing its takeover bid on February 9.     A BankAmerica spokesman said SEC approval is taking longer than expected and market conditions must now be re-evaluated.     "The circumstances at the time will determine what we do," said Arthur Miller, BankAmerica\\\'s Vice President for Financial Communications, when asked if BankAmerica would proceed with the offer immediately after it receives SEC approval.     "I\\\'d put it off as long as they conceivably could," said Lawrence Cohn, analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith.     Cohn said the longer BankAmerica waits, the longer they have to show the market an improved financial outlook.     Although BankAmerica has yet to specify the types of equities it would offer, most analysts believed a convertible preferred stock would encompass at least part of it.     Such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean a lower conversion price and more dilution to BankAmerica stock holders, noted Daniel Williams, analyst with Sutro Group.     Several analysts said that while they believe the Brazilian debt problem will continue to hang over the banking industry through the quarter, the initial shock reaction is likely to ease over the coming weeks.     Nevertheless, BankAmerica, which holds about 2.70 billion dlrs in Brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if the interest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mln dlrs if Brazil pays no interest for a year, said Joseph Arsenio, analyst with Birr, Wilson and Co.     He noted, however, that any potential losses would not show up in the current quarter.     With other major banks standing to lose even more than BankAmerica if Brazil fails to service its debt, the analysts said they expect the de"bt will be restructured, similar to way Mexico\'s debt was, minimizi"ng losses to the creditor banks.

The company said any decline would be due to expenses related to the acquisitions in the middle of the current quarter of seven licensees of Sealy Inc, as well as 82 pct of the outstanding capital stock of Sealy.     Because of these acquisitions, it said, first quarter sales will be substantially h"igher than last year\'s 67.1 mln dlrs.     Noting that it typically "reports first quarter results in late march, said the report is likely to be issued in early April this year.     It said the delay is due to administrative considerations, including conducting appraisals, in connection with the acquisitions.  Reuter \\x03'

S'BankAmerica Corp is not under pressure to act quickly on its proposed equity offering and would do well to delay it because of the sto"ck\'s recent poor performance, banking analysts said.     Some anal"ysts said they have recommended BankAmerica delay its up to one-billion-dlr equity offering, which has yet to be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.     BankAmerica stock fell this week, along with other banking issues, on the news that Brazil has suspended interest payments on a large portion of its foreign debt.     The stock traded around 12, down 1/8, this afternoon, after falling to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news.     Banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of the First Interstate Bancorp <I> takeover bid gone, BankAmerica is under no pressure to sell the securities into a market that will be nervous on bank stocks in the near term.     BankAmerica filed the offer on January 26. It was seen as one of the major factors leading the First Interstate withdrawing its takeover bid on February 9.     A BankAmerica spokesman said SEC approval is taking longer than expected and market conditions must now be re-evaluated.     "The circumstances at the time will determine what we do," said Arthur Miller, BankAmerica\\\'s Vice President for Financial Communications, when asked if BankAmerica would proceed with the offer immediately after it receives SEC approval.     "I\\\'d put it off as long as they conceivably could," said Lawrence Cohn, analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith.     Cohn said the longer BankAmerica waits, the longer they have to show the market an improved financial outlook.     Although BankAmerica has yet to specify the types of equities it would offer, most analysts believed a convertible preferred stock would encompass at least part of it.     Such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean a lower conversion price and more dilution to BankAmerica stock holders, noted Daniel Williams, analyst with Sutro Group.     Several analysts said that while they believe the Brazilian debt problem will continue to hang over the banking industry through the quarter, the initial shock reaction is likely to ease over the coming weeks.     Nevertheless, BankAmerica, which holds about 2.70 billion dlrs in Brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if the interest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mln dlrs if Brazil pays no interest for a year, said Joseph Arsenio, analyst with Birr, Wilson and Co.     He noted, however, that any potential losses would not show up in the current quarter.     With other major banks standing to lose even more than BankAmerica if Brazil fails to service its debt, the analysts said they expect the de"bt will be restructured, similar to way Mexico\'s debt was, minimizi"ng losses to the creditor banks.

S'Dean Foods Co expects earnings for the fourth quarter ending May 30 to exceed those of the same year-ago period, Chairman Kenneth Douglas told analysts.     In the fiscal 1986 fourth quarter the food processor reported earnings of 40 cts a share.     Douglas also sai"d the year\'s sales should exceed 1.4 billion dlrs, up from 1.27 bil"lion dlrs the prior year.     He repeated an earlier projection that third-quarter earnings "will probably be off slightly" from last "year\'s 40 cts a share, falling in the range of 34 cts to 36 cts a s"hare.     Douglas said it was too early to project whether the anticipated fourth quarter performance would be "enough for us to exceed the prior year\\\'s overall earnings" of 1.53 dlrs a share.     In 1988, Douglas said Dean should experience "a 20 pct improvement in our bottom line from effects of the tax reform act alone."     President Howard Dean said in fiscal 1988 the company will derive  benefits of various dairy and frozen vegetable acquisitions from Ryan Milk to the Larsen Co.     Dean also said the company will benefit from its acquisition in late December of Elgin Blenders Inc, West Chicago.     He said the company is a major shareholder of E.B.I. Foods Ltd, a United Kingdom blender, and has licensing arrangements in Australia, Canada, Brazil and Japan.     "It provides ann entry to McDonalds Corp <MCD> we\\\'ve been after for years," Douglas told analysts.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Legislation to require disclosure of credit card fees and interest rates before the cards are issued have been introduced in the Senate and House.     Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn, a co-sponsor of the bill, said many banks and financial institutions do not disclose all the information about terms of their cards in promotional material sent to prospective customers.     "By requiring card issuers to disclose the terms and conditions of their cards at the time of solicitation, the legislation is intended to arm consumers with enough information to shop around for the best deal," Dodd said in a statement.

S'Brown-Forman Inc said its board has approved a three-for-two stock split and a 35 pct increase in the company cash dividend.     The company cited its improved earnings outlook and continued strong cash flow as reasons for raising the dividend.     Brown-Forman said the split of its Class A and Class B common shares would be effective March 13.     The company said directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on each new share of both classes of 28 cts, payable April one to holders of record March 20. Prior to the split, the company had paid 31 cts quarterly.     Brown-Forman today reported a 37 pct increase in third  quarter profits to 21.6 mln dlrs, or 1.00 dlr a share, on a seven pct increase in sales to a record 337 mln dlrs.     Brown-Forman said nine month profits declined a bit to 66.0 mln dlrs, or 3.07 dlrs a share, from 66.2 mln dlrs, or 3.08 dlrs a share, a year earlier due to a second quarter charge of 37 cts a share for restructuring its beverage operations.     The company said lower corporate tax rates and the restructuring "are expected t"o substantially improve Brown-Forman\'s earnings and cash flow in fi"scal 1988."  Reuter \\x03'

S'Venezuela and its bank advisory committee have agreed in principle on revisions to the terms of a 21 billion dlr debt-rescheduling package signed last February, bankers said.     They declined to disclose details because two or three representatives on the panel have still to obtain the approval of their senior management for the new terms.     The committee was meeting in New York this afternoon and could put its final stamp of approval of the deal later today, the bankers said.     "A number of details have still to be finalized, but the broad details of the new amortization schedules and interest rates are in place," one senior banker said.     The interest rate on the rescheduling was originally set at 1-1/8 pct over Eurodollar rates, but Venezuela requested easier terms because of a 40 pct drop in oil income last year.     It also asked for a reduction in the repayments it was due to make in 1987, 1988 and 1989 - after an earlier request that it make no amortizations at all in those years was rebuffed - and sought a commitment from the banks to finance new investment in Venezuela.     The breakthrough in the Venezuelan talks, which have been going on intermittently for several months, follows the announcement earlier today of a 10.6 billion dlr debt rescheduling pact between Chile and its bank advisory panel. "    And last night Citibank said Mexico\'s financing package, includ"ing a 7.7 billion dlr loan, will be signed on March 20.     While the sudden progress is to some extent coincidental, bankers acknowledge a desire to chalk up some quick successes after the shock of Br"azil\'s unilateral interest suspension last Friday. By striking swif"t deals, banks hope to reduce the incentive for other debtors to emulate Brazil.  Reuter \\x03'

S'The Tower Commission report, which says President Reagan was ignorant about much of the Iran arms deal, just about ends his prospects of regaining political dominance in Washington, political analysts said.     "This is certification of incompetence," private political analyst Stephen Hess told Reuters in commenting on the Tower report made public today.     "It\\\'s as if he went before a professional licensing board and was denied credentials."     In one of the most direct criticisms, board chairman John Tower, a longtime Reagan supporter and former Republican senator from Texas, told a press conference, "The president clearly did not understand the nature of this operation."     The report, which lent credence to widespread opinion in Washington that Reagan is not in full command of the government, was particularly damaging because it was prepared by a b"oard of the Republican president\'s own choosing.     The three-memb"er panel made up of Tower, former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Secretary of State Edmund Muskie, does not carry the partisan taint of criticism from a Congress controlled by the Democratic party.     "We\\\'re falling by our own hand," said one Republican political strategist. "What can we say except \\\'we\\\'re sorry, we won\\\'t do it again\\\'?"     The strategist, who works for o"ne of his party\'s top 1988 presidential contenders and asked not to" be identified, said the report was like "an anvil falling on us."     Hess, with the Brookings Institution public policy study group," said the report is the final blow to Reagan\'s hopes of regaining t"he upper hand he once had in dealings with Congress, the press and the Washington bureaucracy.     The report may also undermine the standing of Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Secretary of State George Shultz, who the report suggests were more interested in keeping their own skirts clean than supporting the president.     "They protected the record as to their own positions on this issue. They were not energetic in attempting to protect the president from the consequences," it said.     White House chief of staff Donald Regan and former Central Intelligence Agency Director William Casey also received strong criticism, but the blows were expected in their cases.     Regan, expected to resign or be fired shortly, was savaged for allegedly failing both to help Reagan conduct the Iran initiative and to avoid "chaos" in the disclosure process.     Casey, who underwent surgery for removal of a cancerous brain tumor in December, had already resigned for health reasons last month.     "This is a story about people who came up somewhat short of being heroes," Tower told reporters.     While Reagan retains considerable constitutional powers, including command of the armed forces and the right to veto legislation, analysts say it will be difficult for "him to retake control of the country\'s policy agenda -- particularl"y with Congress controlled by the Democrats.     The crucial remaining question, they said, is whether the man in the street will forsake Reagan over the affair.     Although his job approval rating has fallen as much as twenty percentage points in some opinion polls since the arms deal with Iran became public last November, his personal popularity is still relatively high.     A Los Angeles Times poll released earlier this week showed that just 37 pct of those surveyed thought Reagan was in control of the government, but 55 pct still thought he was doing a good job as president.     American Enterprise Institute analyst William Schneider, a Democrat, says Re"agan\'s loss of support among Washington power brokers could be offs"et by continued backing of the public.     "In the past, he has been able to go around the power elite by appealing directly to the public," Schneider said.     Reagan will again plead his case that way in a televised address next week.     But one top Republican strategist warned against expecting a dramatic turnaround.     "The White House has to avoid building expectations that cannot be met," said the strategist, who requested anonymity. "They have to recognize there is no quick fix."     Analysts also point out that Reagan\\s personal popularity has not always translated into public backing for his policies.     They note he was dramatically rebuffed in la"st November\'s elections when voters rejected his appeals and restor"ed control of the Senate to the Democrats.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Sales of previously owned homes dropped 14.5 pct in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.47 mln units, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) said.     But the December rate of 4.06 mln units had been the highest since the record 4.15 mln unit sales rate set in November 1978, the group said.     "The drop in January is not surprising considering that a significant portion of Decem"ber\'s near-record pace was made up of sellers seeking to get favora"ble capital gains treatment under the old tax laws," said the NAR\\s John Tuccillo.

S'Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Cal.) and Daniel Evans (R-Wash.) said they introduced export licensing reform legislation that could save U.S. companies hundreds of thousands of dollars annually.     "Our emphasis is two-fold: Decontrol and de-license items where such actions will not endanger our national security, and eliminate the Departm"ent of Defense\'s de facto veto authority over the licensing process"," Cranston said.     "Our reforms should reduce licensing requirements by 65  to 70 pct," he told reporters. "I am convinced that a more rational...licensing process will boost exports."     U.S. export controls are intended to deny Eastern bloc countries access to technology that could further their military capabilities.     "By refocusing our control resources on higher levels of technology, technology that is truly critical, we will do a better job of preventing diversion of critical technology to our adversaries while promoting more exports," Cranston said.     "We cannot expect to continue to play a leading role in new technology development in the future if we unduly restrict the activities of U.S. firms in the world market-place," Evans told reporters.

S'Secretary of State George Shultz acknowledged failings in the Iran arms affair but declared he would not resign.     His role in the scandal that has scarred the Reagan administration attracted harsh criticism from the Tower commission in its report on the affair published today.     Shultz, travelling to China for a week-long visit, refused to comment directly on the report, published after he had left Washington. But he repeated -- as he has done since the crisis broke last November -- that he was not going to resign.     "You can wipe that off your slate," he said.  Reuter \\x03'

S'ChemLawn Corp <CHEM> could attract a higher bid than the 27 dlrs per share offered by Waste Management Inc <WNX>, Wall Street arbitrageurs said.     Shares of ChemLawn shot up 11-5/8 to 29-3/8 in over"-the-counter- trading with 3.8 mln of the company\'s 10.1 mln shares" changing hands by late afternoon.     "This company could go for 10 times cash flow or 30 dlrs, maybe 32 dollars depending on whether there is a competing bidder," an arbitrageur said. Waste Managemen"t\'s tender offer, announced before the opening today, expires March" 25.     "This is totally by surprise," said Debra Strohmaier, a C"hemLawn spokeswoman. The company\'s board held a regularly scheduled" meeting today and was discussing the Waste Management announcement. She said a statement was expected but it was not certain when it would be ready.      She was unable to say if there had been any prior contact between Waste Management and ChemLawn officials.     "I think they will resist it," said Elliott Schlang, analyst at Prescott, Ball and Turben Inc. "Any company that doesn\\\'t like a surprise attack would."     Arbitrageurs pointed out it is difficult to resist tender offers for any and all shares for cash. Schlang said ChemLawn could try to find a white knight if does not want to be acquired by Waste Management.     Analyst Rosemarie Morbelli of Ingalls and Snyder said ServiceMaster Companies L.P. <SVM> or Rollins Inc <ROL> were examples of companies that could be interested.     ChemLawn, with about two mln customers, is the largest U.S. company involved in application of fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides on lawns. Waste Management is involved in removal of wastes.     Sc"hlang said ChemLawn\'s customer base could be valuable to another co"mpany that wants to capitalize on a strong residential and commercial distribution system.     Both Schlang and Morbelli noted that hi"gh growth rates had catapulted ChemLawn\'s share price into the mid-""30\'s in 1983 but the stock languished as the rate of growth slowed.""     Schlang said the company\'s profits are concentrated in the fo"urth quarter. In 1986 ChemLawn earned 1.19 dlrs per share for the full year, and 2.58 dlrs in the fourth quarter.     Morbelli noted ChemLawn competes with thousands of individual entrepreuers who offer lawn and garden care sevice.  Reuter \\x03'

The sugar import quota for the 1987 quota year (January-December) has been set at 1,001,430 short tons compared with 1,850,000 tons in the 1986 quota year, which was extended three months to December 31.     The department said the Customs Service has reported that weekly and cumulative imports are reported on an actual weight basis and when final polarizations are received, cumulative import data are adjusted accordingly.

S'inflation plan, initially hailed at home and abroad as the saviour of the economy, is limping towards its first anniversary amid soaring prices, widespread shortages and a foreign payments crisis.     Announced last February 28 the plan froze prices, fixed the value of the new Cruzado currency and ended widespread indexation of the "economy in a bid to halt the country\'s 250 pct inflation rate.    " But within a year the plan has all but collapsed.     "The situation now is worse than it was. Although there was inflation, at least the economy worked," a leading bank economist said.     The crumbling of the plan has been accompanied by a dramatic reversal in the" foreign trade account. In 1984 and 1985 Brazil\'s annual trade surp"luses had been sufficient to cover the 12 billion dlrs needed to service its 109 billion dlr foreign debt.     For the first nine months of 1986 all seemed to be on target for a repeat, with monthly surpluses averaging one billion dlrs. But as exports were diverted and imports increased to avoid further domestic shortages the trade surplus plunged to 211 mln dlrs in October and since then has averaged under 150 mln.  Reuter \\x03'

Under current law, between 40 and 45 mln acres of erodible land must be enrolled in the program by the end of fiscal 1990.     The Republican Task Force on Farm and Rural America, headed by Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (Kan.), said they would consider drafting legislation to increase the reserve by between 15 and 20 mln acres.     Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) told Reuters he would offer a bill to expand the reserve to 67 mln acres.  Reuter \\x03'

S'A surprise 7.5 pct drop in U.S. January durable goods orders points to a slowdown in capital spending that could presage lackluster real growth in the U.S. economy in the first quarter of 1987, economists said.     With total orders, excluding the volatile defense sector, falling a record 9.9 pct, economists agreed that the report painted a bleak picture for the U.S. economy.     But they stressed that the 1987 tax reform laws may be a primary factor behind the drop in orders for business capital investment.     "It\\\'s a rather gloomy outlook for the economy, said David Wyss of Data Resources Inc. "I\\\'m particularly impressed by the 19.7 pct drop in non-defense capital goods orders because it may be a sign that businesses are reacting more adversely to tax reform than we thought."     The Commerce Department pointed out that a record 14.8 pct decline in new orders for machinery was led by declines in office and computing equipment orders.     Economists said the drop in computer orders may have been a response to the lengthening of depreciation schedules and the end of the investment tax credit under the new tax laws.     "It\\\'s more expensive to invest than it used to be, so people just aren\\\'t doing it as much," Wyss said.      Increases in durable" goods orders at year\'s end reinforced the view that businesses ant"icipated the changing tax laws, economists said.     November dura"ble goods orders rose 5.1 pct and December\'s increased 1.5 pct, rev"ised upwards from a previously reported 0.9 pct.     But most acknowledged that the huge January drop was caused by more than tax reform.     "The wash-out that took place in January was far greater than the actual gains that took place in November and December," said Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "The economy has a weakening bent to it early in the year."     "The report definitely points to very sluggish capital spending over the next couple of quarters," said Donald Maude of Midland Montagu Capital Markets Inc.     Maude pointed to a continuing decline in order backlogs as evidence that the outlook for new orders is not improving. In November, order backlogs rose 0.6 pct, but in December they fell 0.6 pct and in January 0.7 pct, he said.     "It suggests orders in the pipeline are depleting, which may quickly translate to a drop in production," Midland Montagu\\\'s Maude said.     Wyss cautioned that too mu"ch should not be made of January\'s report, given that other reports" have reflected strength.     But he acknowledged that the decline occurred despite a 51 pct rise in defense orders, compared with a 57.7 pct decline in December.     He also noted that there was a 6.9 pct drop in January shipments, compared with a 5.4 pct rise in December.     "Given these numbers, there\\\'s no reason for the Fed to tighten," Data Resources\\\' Wyss said.     "But there\\\'s no reason to ease unless we see more numbers like this. The Fed will wait and see," he added.     Sullivan predicted the Fed will ease by Easter. "People aren\\\'t talking recession or Fed easing now, but the Fed will have to ease to ensure global growth."  Reuter \\x03'

S'Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Cal.) and Daniel Evans (R-Wash.) said they introduced export licensing reform legislation that could save U.S. companies hundreds of thousands of dollars annually.     "Our emphasis is two-fold: Decontrol and de-license items where such actions will not endanger our national security, and eliminate the Departm"ent of Defense\'s de facto veto authority over the licensing process"," Cranston said.     "Our reforms should reduce licensing requirements by 65  to 70 pct," he told reporters. "I am convinced that a more rational...licensing process will boost exports."     U.S. export controls are intended to deny Eastern bloc countries access to technology that could further their military capabilities.     "By refocusing our control resources on higher levels of technology, technology that is truly critical, we will do a better job of preventing diversion of critical technology to our adversaries while promoting more exports," Cranston said.     "We cannot expect to continue to play a leading role in new technology development in the future if we unduly restrict the activities of U.S. firms in the world market-place," Evans told reporters.

S'AM International Inc, reporting an operating loss for the January 31 second quarter, said prospects for the balance of the fiscal year remain good.     It said orders at its Harris Graphics subsidiary, acquired in June 1986, "continue to run at a strong pace." For the six months, orders rose 35 pct over the corresponding prior-year period, or on an annualized basis are running at about 630 mln dlrs.     The backlog at Harris is up 30 pct from the beginning of the fiscal year, AM said.     AM International said its old division are expected to benefit from recent new product introductions and the decline in the value of the dollar.     "Research, development and engineering expenditures in fiscal 1987 will be in the 45-50 mln dlr range, and the company said it has allocated another 30-40 mln dlrs for capital expenditures.     Earlier AM reported a fourth quarter operating loss of two cts a share compared to profits of seven cts a share a year ago. Revenues rose to 291.8 mln dlrs from 151.1 mln dlrs.  Reuter \\x03'

The department said the action reduces coverage for sales of dry edible beans to 500,000 dlrs and creates the new line of 1.5 mln dlrs for sales of white corn.     All sales under the credit guarantee line must be registered  and shipped by September 30, 1987, it said.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Argentina could suspend payments on its foreign debt if creditor banks reject a 2.15 billion dlr loan request to meet 1987 growth targets, ruling Radical Party Deputy Raul Baglini told a local radio station.     "Argentina does not discard the use of (a moratorium) if the negotiations do not produce a result that guarantees the growth of the country," he added.     Baglini, an observer at Argentina"\'s negotiations in New York with the steering committee for its 320" creditors banks, told the Radio del Plata in a telephone interview that the banks were divided on the loan request.     Baglini said" that as a result, today\'s scheduled second day of talks had been p"ostponed.     He said Argentina was prepared to follow the example of Brazil, which last week declared a moratorium on interest payments of a large portion of its 108 billion dlr foreign debt.     Ar"gentina\'s prime objective in renegotiating the debt was to maintain" growth, which has been targeted at four pct in 1987, Baglini said.     "Debtor nations should not have to take from their own pockets, that is their commercial balance, to meet interest payments," he added.  Reuter \\x03'

S'The chairmen and senior Republican members of the House and Senate tax writing committees proposed legislation to curb estate tax deduction on sales of stock to an employee stock ownership plan.     The proposal would raise federal revenues of 6.7 billion dlrs over the fiscal year period 1987 to 1991.     If adopted by Congress it would effect all transactions after Sept 26, 1987.     The plan was proposed by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill), Rep John Duncan (R-Tenn), Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex) and Sen Bob Packwood (R-Ore).     In a statement Rostenkowski said the estate tax deduction enacted last year as part of the tax reform bill was too broad and would have cost the governmet seven billion dlrs over four years. The narrower deduction would cost the government less than 300 mln dlrs for the same years.     He said it was designed to avoid sham transactions which allowed estates to avoid taxes by transferring stock to ESOPs.     Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said in a statement, "The Tax Reform Act contains a provision that allows many wealthy individuals to avoid the federal estate tax entirely when they die."     He added, "The provision was intended to encourage estates to sell stock to employee stock ownership plans as a way of promoting worker ownership; however, the provision was not meant to be broad enough to reduce federal revenues as much as is currently estimated."     He added, "The bill I have introduced today calls for the modification of the provision in accordance with its intended purpose."  Reuter \\x03'

S'"Quebecor Inc, one of Canada\'s largest publishing and printing compa"nies, is likely to launch a new daily newspaper in Montreal, probably this fall, president Pierre Peladeau told Reuters in an interview.     The company, which last week won a bid to buy the Quebec go"vernment\'s 55 pct interest in pulp and paper company <Donohue Inc>," will also likely go ahead with plans to build a new paper mill in Matane, Quebec, Peladeau said.     "I would say we will move (ahead with the daily).... This is not definite but i think we will," he said, adding that he plans to announce a decision early next week.     Quebecor, which had revenues of 446 mln Canadian dlrs last year and profit of 16.2 mln dlrs, already publishes three daily newspapers, including the tabloid Le Journal de Montreal, the second-largest circulation paper in Canada.     A new daily would give Montreal its second English- language paper and its sixth daily newspaper, making the city the most crowded metropolitan newspaper market in North America, analysts have said.     Peladeau said market studies have indicated a new English language tabloid would have circulation of 50,000 within six months. He said he is waiting to determine whether the new venture would have the support of major advertisers.     Peladeau, who together with family members owns about 55 pct of Quebecor, said he has recieved offers from the heads of two major Canadian companies who are interested in the project but has not decided whether he would take partners in the newspaper venture.     He said he would consider launching the newspaper with one of the companies as a prelude to other joint ventures.     "It would be the possibility of doing something else in the short term," Peladeau said.     Peladeau said the joint acquisition of Donohue with Ro"bert Maxwell\'s British Printing and Communications Corp plc <BPCL.L"> does not mean Quebecor will have to hold off on other projects. "    Peladeau and Maxwell\'s companies teamed up to buy the stake in "Donohue, which resulted in Quebecor buying 51 pct of the govvernmen"t\'s stake for about 165 mln Canadian dlrs and British printing acqu"iring the other 49 pct.     "In 1976 or 77 there was a tremendous s"hortage of newsprint. There were days when we didn\'t have enough pa"per to print the paper," Peladeau said. "When I lived that, I said to myself...next time we\\\'ll be ready."     Peladeau said most of "Donohue\'s current total newsprint capacity however, is already comm"itted to other buyers.     Quebecor uses about 100,000 metric tons "of newsprint a year and Maxwell\'s company, which publishes Britain\'"s Daily Mirror newspaper, uses about 200,000 tonnes.     Peladeau said even with a new 170 mln dlr paper machine, 49 pct owned by the" New York Times, (NYT.A), adding to Donohue\'s 540,000 metric tonne "capacity this fall, the companies will have to install another paper machine at Amos, Quebec, or build another mill to meet their demands .     He said a new mill, which would produce either newsprint or other types of paper, would cost 400-500 mln dlrs and could be on stream in two years. He said a mill in Matane, a depressed area with high unemployment, would be heavily subsidized by the government.     Peladeau said he is interested in further joint ventures w"ith Maxwell\'s company, either in the newspaper market in France or "in the U.S., where the company owns two large printing plants and i"s looking to expand its newspaper empire.     He said Maxwell\'s son"s, who are French citizens, would provide an entree into the French market, where foreigners are prevented from buying newspapers. Peladeau said he would consider either buying into or starting daily newspapers in France or the U.S.     Quebecor is also in the process of expanding its chain of about 40 weekly newspapers, with the possible acquisition of two groups of weekly newspapers in the U.S., and is negotiating the acquisition of two weekly newspaper chains in Canada, Peladeau said.     He said the company may consider starting daily newspapers in two small Quebec cities and buying radio stations in the province.     Peladeau said Quebecor may also consider trading in its listing on the American stock exchange for a New York Stock Exchange listing.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Iran announced tonight that its major offensive against Iraq in the Gulf war had ended after dealing savage blows against the Baghdad government.     The Iranian news agency IRNA, in a report received in London, said the operation code-named Karbala-5 launched into Iraq on January 9 was now over.     It quoted a joint statewment by the Iranian Army and Revolutionary Guards Corps as saying that their forces had "dealt one of the severest blows on the Iraqi war machine in the history of the Iraq-imposed war."     The statement by the Iranian High Command appeared to herald the close of an assault on the port city of Basra in southern Iraq.     "The operation was launched at a time when the Baghdad government was spreading extensive propaganda on the resistance power of its army...," said the statement quoted by IRNA.     It claimed massive victories in the seven-week offensive and called on supporters of Baghdad to "come to their senses" and discontinue support for what it called the tottering regime in Iraq.     Iran said its forces had "liberated" 155 square kilometers of enemy-occupied territory during the 1987 offensive and taken over islands, townships, rivers and part of a road leading into Basra.     The Iranian forces "are in full control of these areas," the statement said.     It said 81 Iraqi brigades and battalions were totally destroyed, along with 700 tanks and 1,500 other vehicles. The victory list also included 80 warplanes downed, 250 anti- aircraft guns and 400 pieces of military hardware destroyed and the seizure of 220 tanks and armoured personnel carriers.  Reuter \\x03'

S'U.S. bank discount window borrowings less extended credits averaged 310 mln dlrs in the week to Wednesday February 25, the Federal Reserve said.     The Fed said that overall borrowings in the week fell 131 mln dlrs to 614 mln dlrs, with extended credits up 10 mln dlrs at 304 mln dlrs. The week was the second half of a two-week statement period. Net borrowings in the prior week averaged 451 mln dlrs.     Commenting on the two-week statement period ended February 25, the Fed said that banks had average net free reserves of 644 mln dlrs a day, down from 1.34 billion two weeks earlier.     A Federal Reserve spokesman told a press briefing that there were no large" single day net misses in the Fed\'s reserve projections in the week" to Wednesday.     He said that natural float had been "acting a bit strangely" for this time of year, noting that there had been poor weather during the latest week.     The spokesman said that natural float ranged from under 500 mln dlrs on Friday, for which he could give no reason, to nearly one billion dlrs on both Thursday and "Wednesday.     The Fed spokeman could give no reason for Thursday\'s"" high float, but he said that about 750 mln dlrs of Wednesday\'s fl"oat figure was due to holdover and transportation float at two widely separated Fed districts.     For the week as a whole, he said that float related as of adjustments were "small," adding that they fell to a negative 750 mln dlrs on Tuesday due to a number of corrections for unrelated cash letter errors in six districts around the country.     The spokesman said that on both Tuesday and Wednesday, two different clearing banks had system problems and the securities and Federal funds wires had to be held open until about 2000 or 2100 EST on both days.     However, he said that both problems were cleared up during both afternoons and there was no evidence of any reserve impact.     During the week ended Wednesday, 45 pct of net discount window borrowings were made by the smallest banks, with 30 pct by the 14 large money center banks and 25 pct by large regional institutions.     On Wednesday, 55 pct of the borrowing was accounted for by the money center banks, with 30 pct by the large regionals and 15 pct by the smallest banks.     The Fed spokesman said the banking system had excess reserves on Thursday, Monday and Tuesday and a deficit on Friday and Wedndsday. That produced a small daily average deficit for the week as a whole.     For the two-week period, he said there were relatively high excess reserves on a daily avearge, almost all of which were at the smallest banks.  Reuter \\x03'

S'American Express Co remained silent on market rumors it would spinoff all or part of its Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc, but some analysts said the company may be considering such a move because it is unhappy with the market value of its stock.     American Express stock got a lift from the rumor, as the market calculated a partially public Shearson may command a good market value, thereby boosting the total value of American Express. The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial services firm would split its stock and boost its dividend.     American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at 72-5/8, up 4-1/8 on heavy volume.     American Express would not comment on the rumors or its stock activity.     Analysts" said comments by the company at an analysts\' meeting Tuesday helpe"d fuel the rumors as did an announcement yesterday of management changes.     At the meeting, company officials said American Express stock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance of Shearson, according to analysts.     Yesterday, Shearson said it was elevating its chief operating officer, Jeffery Lane, to the added position of president, which had been vacant. It also created four new positions for chairmen of its operating divisions.     Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most sense, contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total spinoff.     Some analysts, however, disagreed that any spinoff of Shearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for American Express, contributing about 20 pct of earnings last year.     "I think it is highly unlikely that American Express is going to sell shearson," said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical. He questioned what would be a better investment than "a very profitable securities firm."     Several analysts said American Express is not in need of cash, which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong asset.     But others believe the company could very well of considered the option of spinning out part of Shearson, and one rumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market.     Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities said he believes American Express could have considered a partial spinoff in the past.     "Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a big premium in the market place. Shea"rson\'s book value is in the 1.4 mln dlr range. Shearson in the mark"et place would probably be worth three to 3.5 bilion dlrs in terms of market capitalization," said Eckenfelder.     Some analysts said American Express could use capital since it plans to expand globally.     "They have enormous internal growth plans that takes capital. You want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to enhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the road," said E.F. Hutton Group analyst Michael Lewis.     "They\\\'ve outlined the "fact that they\'re investing heavily in the future, which goes heavi"ly into the international arena," said Lewis. "...That does not preclude acquisitions and divestitures along the way," he said.     Lewis said if American Express reduced its exposure to the brokerage business by selling part of shearson, its stock might better reflect other assets, such as the travel related services business.     "It could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure to brokerage. The value of the other components could command a higher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of the total operating earnings of the company," he said.      Lewis said Shearson contributed 316 mln in after-tax operating earnings, up from about 200 mln dlrs in 1985.      Reuter \\x03'

S'High feed prices will cause the Chinese to reduce hog herd growth and pork production this year, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     In its World Production and Trade Report, the department said hog numbers at the start of 1987 were estimated at 331.6 mln head, up slightly from 1986, and 10 mln head above earlier projections for 1987.     Pork production in 1986 was up 4.2 pct to 17.25 mln tonnes, slightly below earlier estimates, it said.     For 1987, production is projected to fall to 17.05 mln tonnes.     Feed prices at the end of January were reported 35 to 40 pct above year-ago levels, the department said.  Reuter \\x03'

S'(Ivaco Inc) said price pressure on steel products, particularly in the U.S., and the recent increase in the value of the Canadian dollar is expected to result in "minimal" first quarter earnings.     It said subsequent quarters should show substantial improvement from first quarter levels but 1987 earnings will not reach 1986 levels as long as those conditions continue.      Ivaco earlier reported 1986 profit rose to 44.1 mln dlrs, after a one mln dlr extraordinary gain, from 35.1 mln dlrs the previous year. It said demand for th"e company\'s products are continuing at high levels and sales are ex"pected to show further growth.

The reduction brings its posted price for West Texas Intermediate to 16.00 dlrs a barrel, the copany said.     "The price reduction today was made in the light of falling oil product prices and a weak crude oil market," a company spokeswoman said.     Diamond is the latest in a line of U.S. oil companies that have cut its contract, or posted, prices over the last two days citing weak oil markets.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Coleco Industries Inc said it expects to return to profitability in 1987.     Earlier, Coleco reported a net loss of 111.2 mln dlrs for the year ended December 31 compared to a profit of 64.2 mln dlrs in the year earlier.     In a prepared statement, the company said the dramatic swing in operating results was due primarily to the steep decline in sales of Cabbage Patch Kids products from 600 mln dlrs to 230 mln dlrs.     Coleco said it changed from a single product company to a more diversified organization through four major acquisitions last year.     Products from the new acquisitions and other new product introductions are expected to enable it to return to profitability, it said.     At the annual Toy Fair earlier thi"s month, vice president Morton Handel said analysts\' 1987 projected" earnings of 90 cts a share on sales of 600 mln dlrs are reasonable.      Reuter \\x03'

S'A study on grain certificates due out shortly from the Government Accounting Office (GAO) could show that certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more than cash outlays, administration and industry sources said.     Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the Agriculture Department and the Office of Management and Budget suggests that certificates cost more than cash payments, a GAO official told Reuters.     GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specific request of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), former chairman of the senate agriculture committee.     The report, which will focus on the cost of certificates compared to cash, is scheduled to be released in mid March.     The cost of certificates, said the GAO source," depends on the program\'s impact on the USDA loan program.     If "GAO determines that certificates encourage more loan entries or cause more loan forfeitures, then the net cost of the program would go up. However, if it is determined that certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to decrease, the cost effect of certificates would be less.     GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificates program should be slowed or expanded, the GAO official said.     But a negative report on certificates "will fuel the fire against certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase in the certificate program," an agricultural consultant said.     The OMB is said to be against any expansion of the program, while USDA remains firmly committed to it.  Reuter \\x03'

S'"venezuela is seeking a \'constructive and flexible\' attitude from it"s creditor banks in current talks to reschedule 21 billion dlrs in foreign debt, finance minister manuel azpurua told a press conference.     He declined to comment on meetings this week in new york b"etween public finances director jorge marcano and venezuela\'s 13-ba"nk advisory committee except to say, "they are progressing."     A"zpurua said venezuela has shown solidarity with brazil\'s decision t"o suspend payments, but each country must negotiate according to it"s own interest.     Asked to comment on chile\'s agreement with its "creditors today, which includes an interest rate margin of one pct over libor, azpurua said only, "that is good news."     According "to banking sources, the banks\' latest offer to venezuela is also a ""one pct margin as against the last february\'s 1-1/8 pct reschedulin"g accord and the 7/8 pct Venezuela wants.     Azpurua said four basic elements are being negotiated with the banks now: spread reduction, deferral of principal payments due in 1987 and 1988, lenghtening the 12-1/2 year repayment schedule, and debt capitalization schemes.     Azpurua said the governent plans to pay 2.1 billion dlrs in public and private debt principal this year. It was due to amortize 1.05 billion dlrs under the rescheduling, and pay 420 mln dlrs in non-restructured principal, both public sector.     He said vene"zuela\'s original proposal was to pay no principal on restructured d"ebt this year, but is now insisting that if it makes payments they be compensated by new bank loans.     The banking sources said the committee has been prepared to lower amortizations to around 400 mln dlrs this year, but that no direct commitment was likely on new loans.     "debtors and bank creditors have a joint responsibility and there will be no lasting solution unless a positive flow of financing is guaranteed," azpurua said.     However, he appeared to discard earlier venezuelan proposals for a direct link between oil income and debt payments, "because circumstances change too quickly."     At the same time, he said the government is presently studying possible mechanisms for capitlizing public and private sector foreign debt, based on experience in other countries. The rules would be published by the finance ministry and the central bank.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Thomson McKinnon Mortgage Assets Corp, a unit of Thomson McKinnon Inc, is offering 100 mln dlrs of collateralized mortgage obligations in three tranches that include floating rate and inverse floating rate CMOS.     The floating rate class amounts to 60 mln dlrs. It has an average life of 7.11 years and matures 2018. The CMOs have an initial coupon of 7.0375 pct, which will be reset 60 basis points above LIBOR, said sole manager Thomson McKinnon.     The inverse floater totals 4.8 mln dlrs. It has an average life of 13.49 years and matures 2018. These CMOs were given an initial coupon of 11-1/2 pct and priced at 104.40.     Subsequent rates on the inverse floater will equal 11-1/2 pct minus the product of three times (LIBOR minus 6-1/2 pct).     A Thomson officer explained that the coupon of the inverse floating rate tranche would increase if LIBOR declined. "The yield floats opposite of LIBOR," he said.     The fixed-rate tranche totals 35.2 mln dlrs. It has an average life of 3.5 years and matures 2016. The CMOs were assigned a 7.65 pct coupon and par "pricing.     The issue is rated AAA by Standard and Poor\'s and secu"red by Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp, Freddie Mac, certificates.  Reuter \\x03'

S'OPEC may be forced to meet before a scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide in oil prices, oil industry analysts said.     "The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out the problems," said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, CERA.     Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets.     "OP"EC\'s problem is not a price problem but a production issue and must" be addressed in that way," said Paul Mlotok, oil analyst with Salo"mon Brothers Inc.     He said the market\'s earlier optimism about O"PEC and its ability to keep production under control have given way to a pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices.     But some other analysts were uncertain that even an emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December.     "OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have deemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials," said the regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke on condition that he not be named. "The market is now trying to teach them that lesson again," he added.     David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPEC to meet before June, although not immediately. However, he is not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems.     "They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the winter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and April when demand slackens," Mizrahi said.     But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd."     Analysts said t"hat the next two months will be critical for OPEC\'s ability to hold" together prices and output.     "OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks since buyers will come back into the market then," said Dillard Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New Yor"k.     But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University\'s Energy "and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil has been rising through the first quarter and this may have prompted excesses in its production.     "Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this demand through current production," he told Reuters in a telephone interview.

S'Cenergy Corp reported fourth quarter net income of 790,000 dlrs or seven cts per share on revenues of 7.7 mln dlrs.     For the year it reported a net loss of 6.5 mln dlrs or 70 cts per share as a result of writedowns in the book value of its oil and gas properties in the first two quarters. Revenues were 37 mln dlrs.     Following" the company\'s fiscal year ended March 31, 1985, it changed to a ca"lender year end.     For the nine months ended Dec 31, 1985, it reported a loss of 63.4 mln dlrs or 6.54 dlrs per share on revenues of 47.6 mln dlrs, which it said was a result of noncash writedowns of oil and gas properties.     For the year ended March 31, 1985, Cenergy reported net income of 3,705,000 dlrs or 36 cts per share on revenues of 71 mln dlrs.     The company said its reserves during the year fell to five mln barrels from 6.4 mln barrels of oil and to 60.1 bilion cubic feet of gas from 63.7 BCF. It said these reserves did not disappear but are available to produce as prices recover.  Reuter \\x03'

Nova said the Minister of Regional and Industrial Expansion, Miche"l Cote, ruled that Union Faith\'s purchase of the Husky stake would "not result in Husky ceding control to a non-Canadian company. It said this ruling was a key condition in completing the deal.     Union Faith is equally owned by <Hutchison Whampoa Ltd> and <Hong Kong Electric Holdings Ltd>.     Under the agreement with Union Faith, Husky will become a private company with Union Faith and Nova each holding 43 pct of its stock.     Nine pct of Husky would be owned by relatives of Li Ka-Shing, chairman of Hutchison, and five pct by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerice.  Reuter \\x03'

S'The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) said three troubled banks in Texas and Louisiana were merged with healthy financial institutions.     The FDIC said it subsidized the merger of Central Bank and Trust Co, Glenmora, La., with the healthy Peoples Bank and Trust Co, Natchitoches, La., after state regulators notified it that Central was in danger of failing.     Central had assets of 28.3 mln dlrs.     The FDIC said the deposits of the failed Farmers State Bank, Hart, Tex., were assumed by Hale County State Bank, Plainview, Tex.     Farmers, with 9.6 mln dlrs in assets, was closed by Texas bank regulators.     The deposits of the failed First National Bank of Crosby, Crosby, Tex., with total assets of 8.2 mln dlrs, were assumed by Central Bancshares of the South Inc, Birmingham, Ala., after First National was closed by federal bank regulators, the FDIC said.     The number of federally insured banks to fail so far this year now totals 32, the FDIC said.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Brazil\\\'s 14-bank advisory committee expressed "grave concern" to c"hief debt negotiator Antonio Padua de Seixas over the country\'s sus"pension of interest payments, according to a telex from committee chairman Citibank to creditor banks worldwide.     Bankers said the diplomatic phrase belied the deep anger and frustration on the com"mittee over Brazil\'s unilateral move last Friday and its subsequent" freeze on some 15 billion dlrs of short-term trade and interbank l"ines.     Seixas, director of the Brazilian central bank\'s foreign "debt department, met the full panel on Tuesday and Wednesday.     Seixas, who met again this morning with senior Citibank executive William Rhodes and representatives from committee vice-chairmen Morgan Guaranty Trust Co and Lloyds Bank Plc, told the banks that the government was preparing a telex to explain and clarify the freeze on short-term credits.     The telex could be sent to creditors as early as today, bankers said.     Despite the rising tempers, bankers said there are no plans for Brazilian finance minister Dilson Funaro to meet commercial bankers during his trip to Washington on Fri"day and Saturday.     Funaro will be explaining Brazil\'s actions to" U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker, Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker and International Monetary Fund managing director Michel Camdessus before travelling to Europe at the weekend.     Meanwhile, bankers were to hear in New York this afternoon what impact" Brazil\'s hard line would have on Argentina, with an initial presen"tation from Argentine Treasury Secretary Mario Brodersohn on his co"untry\'s request for 2.15 billion dlrs in new loans and a multi-year" rescheduling agreement. Argentina has threatened to emulate Brazil"\'s payments moratorium if the banks do not grant its request.  Reu"ter \\x03'

S'Liquefied natural gas imports from Algeria are unlikely to happen in 1987 even though its economically feasible, U.S. industry analysts sources said.     Youcef Yousfi, director-general of Sonatrach, the Algerian state petroleum agency, indicated in a television interview in Algiers that such imports would be made this year.     "Contract negotiations, filing with the U.S. government and the time required to restart mothballed terminals will delay the import until 1988/1989," Daniel Tulis, a natural gas analyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. said.     Sonatrach is currently negotiating with two of its former customers, Panhandle Eastern <PEL> and Distrigas, a subsidiary of Cabot Corp <CBT> to resume LNG export, company officials told Reuters. A third, El Paso Gas, a subsidiary of Burlington Northern <BNI>, has expressed no interest.     Industry analysts said some imports of Algerian LNG were feasible. "On a marginal cost basis, the companies that have made capital investment to handle LNG import can operate profitably even in the current price environment,"  Frank Spadine, an energy economist with Bankers Trust, said.    Analysts did not forsee a major impact from Algerian imports on U.S. prices which are currently soft but expected to trend higher by the end of 1987.     A decline in gas drilling and the time lag to bring Gulf of Mexico productions onstream will tighten gas supplies "and firm prices, Shearson\'s Tulis said.    In this context, Algeri"an LNG import would be a source of supplemental supply to U.S. domestic production, he added.     Company sources currently in talks with Algeria agree, saying that Algerian LNG would only serve to meet peak demand.     Company sources also said that any negotiations with Algeria would emphasize looser arrangements which would relate volumes to market requirements and prices to U.S. spot market values.

S'The chairman of the Senate Agriculture subcommittee on credit said the panel will consider a farm credit rescue package by Easter even if the system and its regulator do not ask for help by then.     "We\\\'re going to have a bill to markup, I guarantee you, before the Easter recess," Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.) said.     Senate Majority leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) wants recommendations on farm credit presented by April 11, when Congress is scheduled to break for Easter, Boren said.     Boren urged the Farm Credit Administration (F"CA), the system\'s regulator, to quickly make a formal request for a"id.     Under the 1985 Farm credit law passed by Congress, the FCA, as regulator, is to certify when the system has exhausted all its capital and needs federal government help.     However, FCA chairm"an Frank Naylor said because much of the system\'s remaining capital" is tied-up in legal action, he could not technically certify a rescue is needed this year and perhaps not even in 1988. The other Republican member of the three-man FCA board, Marvin Duncan, agreed.     But Boren urged that even if FCA cannot technically certify aid is needed, it should request help informally.     "We all know we need a capital infusion," Boren said.     Boren and the FCA officials spoke at a hearing on the plight of the farm credit system. Also at the hearing, Brent Beesely, chief executive of the Farm Credit Council representing the system, said that at the end of 1986 the system had only 1.5 billion dlrs in working capital remaining after losses of 4.6 billion dlrs over the last two years.     While he did not ask for government aid, Beesley indicated the situation is serious in some of the 12 system districts.     "A significant number of banks and associations in the most economically depressed areas have and will continue to suffer extraordinary losses," Beesley said.     Jim Billington, Democratic member of the FCA board, said the troubles of the system have encouraged the flight of some one billion dlrs per month from the system as borrowers repay loans.   "  The system\'s total portfolio shrank to 54.6 billion dlrs by the e"nd of last year from 66.6 billion the previous year.     FCA board members said both borrowers and holders of bonds in the system need to be assured their money is safe. Naylor suggested the need for a federal assurance to bondholders.     "The bondholders have no worry at this time," Billington said.     Naylor said several proposals for revamping the farm credit system are circulating. The proposals range from consolidation of the system into a centralized national lender, to de-centralizing into semi-independent institutions.     But He and the system spokesman Beesley were cautious about proposals for a secondary market on farm loans. Those proposals would package farm loans for resale to investors.     Naylor and Beesley said a secondary market set-up outside the farm credit system would hurt the system. But Beesley said a secondary market with the farm credit system as its agent could be developed without Congressional legislation.  Reuter \\x03'

S'"The Tower Commission\'s scathing    comments on President Reagan\'s e"mbattled chief of staff Donald Regan could signal the death knell to his White House tenure, but the impact of its strong criticism on two other top officials was less clear.     Regan has come in for" tough criticism for his handling of Reagan\'s worst political crisi"s since details of the covert arms sales to Iran and diversion of profits to Nicaraguan rebels first emerged last November.     But criticism of the roles of Secretary of State George Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, who said they opposed the Iran arms initiative yet failed to end it, had been muted until the release of the Tower Commission report.     "Their obligation was to give the president their full support and continued advice with respect to the program or, if they could not in conscience do that, to so inform the president," the report said after a three-month probe.     "Instead, they simply distanced themselves from the program. They protected the record as to their own positions on this issue. They were not energetic in attempting to protect the president from the consequences of his personal commitment to freeing the hostages."     The report saved some of its most scathing language for Regan, a gruff former Wall Street executive and close personal friend of Reagan whose autocratic rule in the White House angered some top Rea"gan officials and, perhaps more importantly, Reagan\'s wife Nancy. "    "More than almost any chief of staff of recent memory, he asserted personal control over the White House staff and sought to extend this control to the national security adviser," said the report. "    Washington analysts said Regan\'s departure now appeared to be o"nly a matter of timing. Many expected the president to announce it "when he addresses the nation on the Tower Commission\'s findings nex""t week.     With Regan\'s departure apparently imminent and Poindext"er and other key figures in the scandal already out of office, the "report\'s tough criticism of Shultz and Weinberger could turn the sp"otlight on their future.     Senate Republican leader Robert Dole, a key Reagan ally, told reporters the report disclosed "colossal blunders" and said people who had not served the president well should step aside, but he did not specify who should go.     "It would "seem to me that if you don\'t protect the president, you don\'t serve" the president well, then you should move on," the Kansas Republican, a likely presidential candidate next year, said.     One Republican strategist said he believed Regan would not be the only White House official to leave in the near future.      Reuter \\x03'

S'"Switzerland\'s economy, combining low unemployment, financial stabil"ity and a large external payments surplus, is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory future, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, said.     This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government, it said.     The OECD, in its annual report on Switzerland, picked out some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in inflation this year, but said these gave no cause for concern.     The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product growth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986 and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct af"ter last year\'s sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985.     B"ut it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest increase in the workforce, leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at around one pct, the lowest in the 24-industrial nation OECD area.     Assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 Swiss francs to the dollar this year, against 1.69 in the second half of 1986, the report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pct rise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pct respectively in 1986.     The faster growth of imports compared with exports this year and last, reflecting buoyant private consumption, meant that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP would shrink in both years.     But "given Switzerland\\\'s large external surplus, there should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than GDP...Which, if only in a small way, would contribute to improving international balances," the OECD said.     Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually buoyant last year, with a 3.25 pct growth rate, after several years of relative weakness, it noted.     In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat to a 2.25 pct growth rate, but should still outstrip overall GDP, it added.     The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained bright into 1987, and with capacity use at near record levels last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation in both the industry and service sectors, it said.     As a consequence, growth in machinery and equipment investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year after vigorous growth in 1986.     But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for tourism and the banking industry, two major service sector earners of foreign exchange.     The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc, and the accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets, could lead to a loss of international market share for both, it said.     Particularly for the banks, "recent developments in international financial markets give rise to the question whether the Swiss financial system, which has shown substantial flexibility in the past, is adapting itself at the speed required ... To preserve its competitive position," it said.  REUTER \\x03'

S'The U.S. Agriculture Department is not actively considering offering subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union under the export enhancement program (EEP), senior USDA officials said.     However, grain trade analysts said the proposal has not been ruled out and that an offer might be made, though not in the very near future.     "The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again," an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said. "But there just isn\\\'t much talk about it, informally or formally."     Most analysts interviewed by Reuters were more confident than USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to the Soviets, even though U.S. officials did not make such an offer when they held grain talks with Soviet counterparts earlier this week.     But administration and private sources agreed that if the Reagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat to Moscow, it could take several months.     "I ju"st don\'t see any proposal like that sailing through any interagency" process," the aide to Lyng said.     "An export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight," said one former USDA official, who noted that the administration took three months to decide in favor of selling China wheat under the subsidy program.     An official representing a large grain trade company said deliberations within USDA might be nudged along by members of Congress, a number of whom urged USDA this week to make a wheat subsidy offer to the Soviets. "    But Lyng\'s aide said that during a day-long visit to Capitol Hi"ll yesterday, House members did not press the secretary on the subs"idy question a single time.     The administration\'s interagency tr"ade policy review group, comprised of subcabinet-level officials, has not been asked to clear a request to offer Moscow wheat under th"e EEP, officials at the U.S. Trade Representative\'s Office said.  "   In their talks this week, the two sides discussed the administra"tion\'s previous EEP offer but did not talk about any new initiative". One USDA official who took part in the consultations this week described them as an exchange of "calm, basic, factual economics."     Another USDA official said there was "not even an informal suggestion or hint" that the Soviets would live up to their pledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were granted more favorable terms.     USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of an EEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would be delayed because of disarray within the White House stemming from the Iran arms affair.

S'The U.S. Treasury said it was willing to participate with several other industrial countries in providing a 500 mln-dlr short-term bridge loan to Argentina.     The Treasury announcecement did not name the other countries nor the amount of financing the United States was willing to supply.     Argentina announced a wage and price freeze on Wednesday night and is negotiating with New York bankers for about 2.15 billion dlrs in new loans and other financing.     "Our willingness to participate in this multilateral short-term finan"cing indicates our support for Argentina\'s economic program to achi"eve sustainable growth and a viable balance of payments position," the Treassury statement said.     In announcing a four-month wage and price freeze, Argentine officials said the country needed "a more serene climate" to carry out structural changes in the economy.     But Argentina did not suspend interest payments on its foreign debts, as neighboring Brazil did last week.     The Treasury said the U.S. share of bridge financing for Argentina would come from its Exchange Stabilization Fund.     The one-page statement noted the "International Monetary Fund expressed confidence in Argentina\'s eco"nomic policies and prospects by approving a new stand-by financing arrangement for it on February 18.     "Argentina is expected to qualify for IMF balance-of-payments financing which would enable Argentina to repay a multilateral bridge loan and support the implementation of its economic program," the statement said.     The latest Argentine action marked the second time in less than two years its government has used a wage and price freeze to restrain inflation.     The debt talks in New York are being headed by Argentine Finance Minister Mario Brodersohn and are expected to last for several days.     Along with new financing, Argentina reportedly wants lower interest rates on an existing total 53 billion dlrs in foreign "debt and elimination of foreign banks\' control over how some of the" money is loaned in Argentina.

S'Brazil\\\'s 14-bank advisory committee expressed "grave concern" to c"hief debt negotiator Antonio Padua de Seixas over the country\'s sus"pension of interest payments, according to a telex from committee chairman Citibank to creditor banks worldwide.     Bankers said the diplomatic phrase belied the deep anger and frustration on the com"mittee over Brazil\'s unilateral move last Friday and its subsequent" freeze on some 15 billion dlrs of short-term trade and interbank l"ines.     Seixas, director of the Brazilian central bank\'s foreign "debt department, met the full panel on Tuesday and Wednesday.     Seixas, who met again this morning with senior Citibank executive William Rhodes and representatives from committee vice-chairmen Morgan Guaranty Trust Co and Lloyds Bank Plc, told the banks that the government was preparing a telex to explain and clarify the freeze on short-term credits.     The telex could be sent to creditors as early as today, bankers said.     Despite the rising tempers, bankers said there are no plans for Brazilian finance minister Dilson Funaro to meet commercial bankers during his trip to Washington on Fri"day and Saturday.     Funaro will be explaining Brazil\'s actions to" U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker, Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker and International Monetary Fund managing director Michel Camdessus before travelling to Europe at the weekend.     Meanwhile, bankers were to hear in New York this afternoon what impact" Brazil\'s hard line would have on Argentina, with an initial presen"tation from Argentine Treasury Secretary Mario Brodersohn on his co"untry\'s request for 2.15 billion dlrs in new loans and a multi-year" rescheduling agreement. Argentina has threatened to follow Brazil in declaring a payments moratorium if the banks do not grant its request.  Reuter \\x03'

S'"Dow Chemical Co\'s <DOW> Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc unit said a" jury found that Bendectin did not cause the birth defects of a seven-year old boy whose mother took the drug during pregnancy.     The anti-nausea drug has been used to treat morning  sickness and was discontinued in 1983 amid allegations that the drug caused birth defects.     Merrell said that to date there have been 12 other trials involving the drug, 10 in the U.S. and two in West Germany.     It said verdicts or judgements in favor of the company were obtained in eight of the trials, one of which included about 1,150 plaintiffs.     In two trials, Merrell said, verdicts were in favor of the plaintiffs. In one, it said, the trial judge overruled the jury"\'s verdict and issued a judgement in favor of the company and a thr""ee judge panel of the Court of Appeals overturned the trial judge\'s" ruling. Merrell is now awaiting a rehearing of this case by the full Court of Appeals.     Of the remaining two trials, one ended in a mistrial and in the other the jury was unable to reach a verdict.     At one point about 1700 lawsuits had been filed alleging the drug caused birth defects, said a company spokesman. He said about 300 lawsuits are pending.     Bendectin was first introduced in the early 1950s, and the Merrell spokesman said a valid application to make and market the drug is with the Food and Drug Administration should the company decide it wants to reintroduce it.

S'The U.S. Agriculture Department probably will not offer a two dlr per bushel bonus payment to corn farmers for any erodible cropland they enrolled in the conservation reserve program last year, an aide to USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said.     Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) said yesterday that Lyng had indicated he would consider giving those farmers the same two dlr bonus offered corn farmers who are signing up for the 1987 program this month.     But the aide to Lyng said it was doubtful that the department would offer a retroactive bonus to farmers who enrolled land in the 10-year conservation reserve last year.     "How are you going to stop the tide," he said, referring to demands that would follow from other commodity groups.  Reuter \\x03'

S'The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) proposed to ease evacuation standards for nuclear plants, which could lead the way to the licensing of controversial plants in New York and New Hampshire.     The NRC voted 4-1 to offer the rule for 60 days of public comment before it reconsidered it and set emergency evacuation standards of its own.     Local authorites at the plants at Shoreham, Long Island, N.Y., and Seabrook, N.H., had refused to take part in evacuation planning, as required under existing NRC rules.     They had claimed the region was too populated for any safe evacuation plan, holdi"ng up the NRC\'s authority to issue full power licenses of the two m"ulti-billon dollar plants.     A group of prominent politicians, led by New York Governor Mario Cuomo, charged at a public meeting on the proposed plan on Tuesday that NRC members were more interested "in protecting the utilties\'investments than protecting public safet"y.     An NRC spokesman said after the meeting that the agency had not yet scheduled a meeting to vote on the proposed plan.     In a statement today announcing its vote, the commission said the proposed rule change would enable the NRC to act in cases where local authorities refused to take part in emergency evacuation planning.

S'U.S. farmers who in the past have grown oats for their own use but failed to certify to the government that they had done so probably will be allowed to continue planting that crop and be eligible for corn program benefits, an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said.     Currently a farmer, to be eligible for corn program benefits, must restrict his plantings of other program crops to the acreage base for that crop.     Several members of Congress from Iowa have complained that farmers who inadvertantly failed to certify that they had grown oats for their own use in the past now are being asked to halt oats production or lose corn program benefits.     USDA likely will allow historic oats farmers to plant oats but not" extend the exemption to all farmers, Lyng\'s aide said.  Reuter \\x03"'

S'The sharp decline in soybean crush ratios seen in the last few weeks, accelerating in recent days, has pushed margins below the cost of production at most soybean processing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybean meal and oil.     The weekly U.S. soybean crush rate was reported by the National Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 21.78 mln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over the past two months when crush margins surged to the best levels seen in over a year.     Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushed soybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick-up in the weekly crush number.     However, much of that export demand seems to have been met, with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge in shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the next few months.     U.S. processors are now finding domestic livestock feed demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder than normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices in an attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said.     Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent weeks, setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in the nearby March contract today.     "Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and sold May, looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow, which would cause March to gain on deferreds)," one CBT crush trader said.     "But they\\ve been bailing out this week because the March has been acting like there will be a lot delivered, if not tomorrow, then later in the month," he added.     As a result of the weakness in soymeal, the March crush ratio (The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans) fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents per bushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last two days.     The May crush ended today just over 17 cents, so no processors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable level, the trader said. Hopefully, they will now start to cut back production to get supplies in line with demand, he added.     With futures down, processors are finding they must bid premiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins.     A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 cents for every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices, down sharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below the average cost of production, cash dealers said.     Most soybean processing plants are still in operation, with little talk of taking temporary down-time, so far. But processors will start halting production in the next few weeks it they continue to face unprofitable margins, they added.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Latest Federal Reserve data suggest that the central bank voted to maintain the existing degree of pressure on banking reserves at its regular policy-making meeting two weeks ago, money market economists said.     "The numbers were a little disappointing, but I think we can take Mr Volcker at his word when he said that nothing had changed," said Bob Bannon of Security Pacific National Bank.     Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told a Congressional committee last Thursday that the Fed\\\'s policy "has been unchanged up to today."     Alth"ough Volcker\'s statement last Thursday allayed most fears that the "Fed had marginally tightened its grip on reserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wanted confirmation of a steady poli"cy in today\'s data, which covered the two-week bank statement perio"d ended yesterday.     This need for additional reassurance was mad"e all the more acute by the Fed\'s decision yesterday to drain reser"ves from the banking system by arranging overnight matched sale-purchase agreements for the first time since April of last year, econ"omists added.     Today\'s data showed that the draining action was "for a fairly large 3.9 billion dlrs, economists said.     "The one thing that caught my eye were the relatively sizeable matched sales on Wednesday," said Dana Johnson of First National Bank of Chicago. "But there was a clearly justified need for them. There was nothing ominous."     "The Fed couldn\\\'t have waited until the start of the new statement period today. If it had, it would have missed its (reserve) projections," added Security Pacific\\\'s Bannon.     A Fed spokesman told reporters that there were no large single-day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week.     Economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher-than- expected adjusted bank b"orrowings from the Fed\'s discount window, which averaged 310 mln dl""rs a day in the latest week, compared with many economists\' forecas"ts of about 200 mln.     For the two-week bank statement period as a whole, the daily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from 160 in the prior period.     "There were wire problems at two large banks on Tuesday and Wednesday, so I am not too bothered about the borrowings," said Scott Winningham of J.S. Winningham and Co. The Wednesday average rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier.     Lending further support to the stable policy view was a relatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in the latest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves in the banking system, economists said.     "For the time being, the Fed is following a neutral path, with fed funds at about six to 6-1/8 pct," said Darwin Beck of First Boston Corp. "I expect it to continue in that vein."     "Excess reserves fell but they are still over a billion dlrs," added First Chicago\\\'s Johnson. Banks\\\' excess reserves averaged 1.03 billion dlrs a day in the latest statement period, down from 1.50 billion in the previous one.     After the Fed declined to assign a 1987 target growth range to the wayward M-1 money supply measure last week, little attention was paid to a steeper-than-anticipated 2.1 billion dlr jump in the week ended February 16.     Looking ahead, economists said the Fed will have to tread a "fine line between the dollar\'s progress in the international curren"cy markets and the development of the domestic economy.     "The market has perhaps exaggerated the dollar\\\'s effect on Fed policy," said First Chicago\\\'s Johnson. "Of course, it will take the dollar into account in future policy decisions but if the economy is weak, it won\\\'t pull back from easing."  Reuter \\x03'

S'The New York Stock Exchange said it will begin a review of regulation in the securities industry to determine what changes may be needed to maintain the integrity of the market and protect investors in coming years.     The Exchange said the study is needed because of the rapid changes taking place in the securities industry. Among the factors it cited were the increase in trading volume, the proliferation of new trading instruments and the rise of computerized trading techniques.     The Exchange did not mention, however, the insider trading scandal that has caught several top Wall Street executives.     The NYSE said its study will be chaired by Richard R. Shinn, executive vice chairman of the Exchange and former chairman and chief executive officer of <Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.>     Other members of the study committee include Charles F. Barbar, former chairman of Arsarco Inc <AR>, Roger Birk, chairman emeritus of Merrill Lynch and Co <MER> and Irwin Guttag, chairman of the NYSE" special surveillance committee.     The committee\'s report should "be completed by the end of the year, the Exchange said.  Reuter \\x03'

S'McDonnell Douglas Corp said Korean Air signed formal orders for four MD-11 jets with options to buy four more.     The company said if the options are exercised, the purchase will total about one billion dlrs.     McDonnell Douglas said on December 30 that Korean Air was among the initial 12 customers that placed orders and options for 92 aircraft valued at about nine billion dlrs.     Delivery of the first MD-11 is scheduled for the summer of 1990.         Korean Airlines currently operates four McDonnell Douglas DC-10 jets. In 1985, it ordered six MD-82s valued at about 150 mln dlrs. Four of these are in service and two will be delivered this year.  Reuter \\x03'

The 116-foot (35.4-meter) Delta -- a reliable workhorse of the U.S. rocket fleet -- lifted off at 1805 EST from Cape "Canaveral Air Force Station in a crucial test of the space agency\'s" ability to recover from the Challenger disaster and a string of other failures.     The launch came after two delays in two days. The first postponement was caused by fuel leak and the second by high-speed crosswinds that NASA officials say could have torn the rocket apart during fiery ascent.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Japan has pledged to try to increase its purchase of U.S. car parts and also to exchange data to monitor the purchases, the Commerce Department said.     U.S. negotiators opened talks last August with Japanese officials to try to force open the Japanese market to American-made parts in an effort to redress an estimated five billion dlr deficit in car parts trade.     Japan had agreed to try to increase purchases of U.S.-made parts by Japanese car makers and to begin long term contracts for parts purchases, a Commerce department official said.     He added that the agreement also said Japan agreed to try to devise a way to collect purchasing information in order to monitor progress in stepping up Japanese orders.     The Commerce Department said in a statement last year that "statistics support the perception in the United States that American auto parts sup"pliers are not welcome in the inner circles of Japan\'s auto compani"es and their traditional suppliers."     It estimated that while J"apan\'s car firms sold almost five billion dlrs worth of parts in th"e United States in 1985, U.S. firms sold only one per cent of Japan"\'s 55 billion dlr market.  reuter \\x03"'

S'"France\'s right wing government is facing growing pressure to modify" its economic policies after revising down its 1987 growth targets and revising up its inflation forecasts for this year.     Moving reluctantly into line with most private sector forecasts the government yesterday raised its 1987 inflation estimate a half percentage point to 2.5 per cent and cut its economic growth estimate to between two and 2.8 per cent from a 2.8 per cent target written into the annual budget last september.     Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revised figures would not push the government off its chosen mix of price deregulation, budget-cutting rigour and pay restraint.     But Trade Union leaders served immediate notice they would push to protect the purchasing power of their members, raising the spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises.     And bank economists contacted by Reuters said they believed Prime Minister Jacques Chirac could be forced by slow growth and rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year, perhaps in the autumn, to boost his prospects in Presidential elections due by April 1988.     "The outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago," said Societe Generale economist Alain Marais. "We have the impression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth this year."     "The big question is whether the government\\\'s policy of wage moderation will be maintained," he added.     The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout 1.7 per cent this year, with a three per cent ceiling for rises justified by increased productivity.     But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation, Edmond Maire, meeting with Chirac today, renewed union demands already rejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built into future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher prices.     Calling the government\\\'s policies "unbalanced and unjust," he also demanded investment incentives to boost employment. He announced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the government would spend two billion francs on a series of measures to boost employment and training     Andre Bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderate Force Ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to Chirac earlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT, the largest of Fran"ce\'s unions, declared the defence of its members earnings its top p"riority.     But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, and still rising, government supporters and some economic analysts said they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands.     "Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialist government and I dont think this administration is going to reverse that," commented Michel Develle, economist at recently-privatised Banque Paribas.     Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmas and the New Year, partly blamed by the government for higher inflation, had undermined the unions power and popularity, he said.     Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even more than the governments revised forecast, perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7 per cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent.     "But that would still be an exceptional achievement considering that for the first time since the Second World War all french prices have been freed," he commented.     Finance Ministry officials said that the governments abolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible for nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in January living costs.     But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that should have no knock-on impact on the rest of the year.     Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that, so long as the government kept wages under control.     Prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of 1987 and two per cent in the first half year, fractionally more than forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute, INSEE,  Marais said. But the second half year should be better, he added.     Ironically, one side effect of higher inflation could be to help the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget deficit, several analysts said.     So long as public sector wages are held down, higher Value Added Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a loss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than expected growth, they said.

S'"Japan\'s unadjusted consumer price index (base 1985) fell 0.4 pct to"" 99.7 in January from the previous month, the government\'s Manageme"nt and Coodination Agency said.     The fall compares with a decline of 0.2 pct in December.     The January index compared with a year earlier was down 1.1 pct, the first drop larger than 1.0 pct since it fell 1.3 pct in September 1958.     Food costs rose in January from December but prices fell for clothing, footwear and utilities, causing the overall decline for the month.     Housing, medical and educations costs increased in January compared with a year earlier but the cost of utilities, gasoline and vegetables fell.     The unadjusted consumer price index for the Tokyo area (base 1985) was down 0.1 pct in mid-February from a month earlier at 100.2, reflecting lower prices for food, clothing and footwear. Compared with a year earlier, the index was down 0.7 pct due to lower vegetable, fuel oil and utility costs.  REUTER \\x03'

S'The Finance Ministry has proposed informally to its bond underwriting syndicate that the coupon on the January 10-year government bond remain unchanged from February at five pct, underwriting sources said.     They said the ministry wants a 0.50 yen raise in issue price from February to 99.50 to yield a record low 5.075 pct.     The 5.151 pct February bond issue yield was itself a record low. The proposed issue volume is 475 billion yen against the 600 billion in February.     The underwriting syndicate is likely to accept the proposed terms immediately, the sources said.  REUTER \\x03'

S'An unmanned Delta rocket carrying a 57 mln dlr weather observation satellite blasted off here today in the first U.S. Space launch of the year.     The 116-foot rocket lifted off at 1805 local time (2305 GMT) and placed in orbit a 1,850 pound Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) to replace an identical one that was destroyed last May when a Delta rocket exploded after liftoff.     Weather forecasters have had only a single satellite to cover the entire U.S. Since another GOES failed in orbit in August 1984.     "We\\\'ll have both our weather eyes open again," said Thomas Pyke, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which owns and operates the satellite.     The smooth launching came after two delays in as many days. The first was caused by a fuel leak and the second by powerful crosswinds.     The Delta was the first of six rockets scheduled for launch by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration this year. The launch marked the third straight success for the space program which was battered by a series of failures in 1986, including the loss of the Challenger shuttle.  REUTER \\x03'

S'"Leaders of Italy\'s five coalition parties have agreed to meet today" to try to settle their differences which are mainly between Prime "Minister Bettino Craxi\'s Socialist Party and the majority Christian" Democrats.     Sources close to Deputy Prime Minister Arnaldo Forlani said Craxi told him he would announce his resignation next week, allowing negotiations on a new government leader.     The conservative Christian Democrats demanded the meeting after Craxi said a pact agreed during a government crisis last August, under which he "was to hand over the prime minister\'s job next month, was unlikely "to be fulfilled.     Political sources said the Christian Democrats are likely to leave the coalition, which also includes Republicans, Social Democrats and Liberals, unless they get the prime minister"\'s job. They said Craxi\'s plans to resign show he has decided to s"tick to the pact but talks on a leader, a government program and sharing of ministries will not be easy.     They said there is dissent among the partners and that Forlani has been trying to mediate to avoid a crisis. They said the five are likely to begin talks tomorrow on whether formation of a new government is feasible or early elections are inevitable. Elections are not due until 1988.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Monetary and credit growth rates in New Zealand are not expected to" continue at current levels following the Reserve Bank\'s move to ti"ghten liquidity late last year, Reserve Bank Governor Spencer Russell said.     The monetary and credit growth figures for the December quarter were probably artifically inflated by unusually high growth in inter-institutional lending activity on the short term money market, Russell said in a statement.     The bank moved to tighten liquidity when the initial signs of the recent expansion became apparent in September and October last year, Russell said.     Broadly defined M-3 figures released today showed growth of 17.8 pct in the year ended December compared with 13.1 pct in the year ended September.     Annual growth of private sector credit in calendar 1986 was 30.7 pct compared with 16.5 pct in the September year.     "Available evidence suggests that corporate customers, including non-bank financial institutions, have been exploiting differences between interest rates on overdrafts with trading banks and rates in the call market," Russell said.

S'Japanese life insurers, trust banks and corporations, largely responsible for vitalising the U.S. Bond market in recent years, are now eyeing stockmarkets in the U.S., Britain, France and Hong Kong, fund managers said.     After concentrating on U.S. Treasury bonds for years, Japanese institutions now see a risk in relying too much o"n similar types of investments, they said.     Japan\'s net buying "in overseas stockmarkets this year may double or triple to 15-20 billion dlrs from seven billion in 1986, Shigeki Matsumoto of Nikko S"ecurities Co Ltd, said.     Matsumoto, who manages Nikko\'s investme"nt research and strategy, said there is evidence Japanese investors began poking around in foreign stockmarkets around July last year, but few made firm commitments until December when net purchases suddenly grew to 1.5 billion dlrs from around 500 mln in each of the previous five months.     Net buying in 1985 totalled only 995 mln dlrs, he added.     This sudden penchent for overseas stocks is likely to draw the widest smiles from Wall Street because about 70 to 80 pct of funds will be invested in the U.S. Markets, Matsumoto said.     "The trend has been to head toward the U.S. Market, first because of its size and next because it has been successful over the last couple of years," said Eugene Atkinson, managing director of" Goldman Sachs International Corp.     Wall Street\'s massive turnov"er offers good liquidity, enabling institutions to easily move large volumes of money in and out of shares with the minimum of risk, he added.     However, few see holdings in U.S. Treasuries dwindling. They will remain a Japanese mainstay, fund managers said.     Institutions, particularly life insurance companies which concentrate on income rather than capital gains to cover payouts to policy holders, are unlikely to sell their U.S. Treasuries, but will put in less money, said Shinichi Kobuse, manager of Yamaichi Securities Co "Ltd\'s international fixed income activities.     There has been so"me selling of U.S. Bonds by short-term investors, but the selling is unlikely to amount to a significant chunk of Japanese bond holdings because the liquidity of the U.S. Bond market remains attractive, he added.     Kobuse said investment managers are bullish on the U.S. Equity markets despite predictions by economists the U.S. Economy will remain sluggish over the next couple of months.     Interest in Wall Street has been spurred by recent reports of significant growth in earnings by major U.S. Corporations, he added.     Yutaka Hashimoto general manager of Nippon Life Insurance Co told an economic conference that insurance companies, which are responsible for 26 pct of Japanese funds in foreign securities, hold a lopsided proportion of U.S. Treasuries and intend to diversify into other instruments and currencies.     Insurance companies have put the dominant portion of their funds into the U.S., But will now invest in Britain, West Germany, France and other countries, Hashimoto said.     Lower interest rates worldwide make the returns on stocks relatively high in comparison with bonds and in light of the strength in the yen, the growth in stock values is expected to offset currency risks, he added.     One trust bank official said his bank aims for a 10 pct annual return on overseas investments but the recent decline in U.S. 30-year bond yields has caused a rethink in pension fund investment stategies.     The bank is looking more at U.S. Equities and European bonds, he said.     Japanese investments in British equities have already turned active and the pace is likely to increase, said Andrew Sheaf, general manager of international equity activities at County Securities Japan.     "Last week was the busiest week we had," he said.     Investments are being spurred by the growth in profits of British companies and the recent deregulation of government controlled firms, fund managers said.     Deregulation in France is also attracting Japanese interest, but stock investments there will be inhibited by worries about the French franc, they said.     Investments in Hong Kong will be mostly short-term a"nd speculative due to uncertainty about the colony\'s long-term pol"itical stability, they added.     Japanese investors are cautious about West Germany, particularly as German firms, like their Japanese counterparts, are concerned about the recent dollar fall.     Australia also poses some risks due to currency values, they added.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Japan is expected to cut the base lending rate for state financial institutions to 5.5 pct from 6.2 as part of the recent pact by major industrial nations in Paris, Finance Ministry sources said.     They said the cut is based on a revision of the Trust Fund Bureau Law, which should be approved by parliament on March 3, abolishing the 6.05 pct minimum interest rate on deposits with the bureau.     The bureau channels funds to government financial institutions for public works and other official uses, they said.     The base lending rate for state bodies such as the Japan Development Bank, Peop"le\'s Finance Corp and the finance corporations of local public ente"rprises usually moves in tandem with long-term prime rates, the sources said.     However, it was impossible for them to follow the last cut, to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on January 28, because the Trust Fund Bureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct.     The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce a market-related one to resolve the problem and stimulate the domestic economy, they said.     On Tuesday, the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cut their prime to a record low of 5.5 pct, effective February 28. The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors using the bureau, the postal savings system of the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the sources said.     These ministries are trying to determine" which market rates should be considered when setting the bureau\'s "deposit rate, the ministry sources said.     Coupon rates on new 10-year government bonds, minus 0.1 percentage points, is the likeliest choice, they added.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Domestic demand is now expected to make no contribution to Australian economic growth in fiscal 1986/87, ending June 30, while net exports will account for all of the overall increase, Treasurer Paul Keating said here.     However, he did not say in his speech to the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) if the forecast 2.25 pct rise in gross domestic product (gdp) had been revised.     But Keating said domestic demand could fall slightly this financial year and net export growth will provide the total source of gdp growth.     The August budget had forecast domestic demand would contribute 0.75 percentage points to non-farm gdp growth of 2.5 pct while net exports would account for 1.75 points.     Keating said the overall impact of the changed economic parameters is welcome as it appears to have contributed to a slightly more rapid correction in the current account deficit than first anticipated.     "The government initially forecast a current account deficit for 1986/87 of 14.75 billion -- our present expectation is that the result will be somewhat lower, around 14 billion," he said.     Partial indicators released since the last meeting of EPAC in December indicate that the 1986/87 budget strategy is broadly on track, Keating said.     "They indicate that domestic demand has been a little more sluggish than was expected at budget time," he said.     "On the other hand, net exports seem to be expanding by more than expected at budget time, and this is underpinning growth in domestic production and employment."     Keating said it now seems likely that the 1986/87 inflation rate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct.     "Nevertheless, there is likely to be a marked slowing in inflation over coming quarters as depreciation and budgetary effects wane," he said.     Keating said the government expects economic growth to pick up moderately in 1987/88 due to a further significant rise in net exports and a very moderate but positive contribution from private domestic demand.     He said domestic demand growth will be due to a strengthening in real household disposable income.     The moderate rise in economic growth next financial year should be sufficient to sustain employment growth at a level broadly equivalent to that of the current fiscal year.     "The current account deficit will continue to show improvement in 1987/88," Keating said.     "As the impact of the exchange rate depreciations of recent years recede further, and given continued effective wage restraint, inflation should moderate markedly in 1987/88," he said.  REUTER \\x03'

S'The Philippines will offer its commercial bank creditors an innovative pricing plan that will make debt payments through certificates of indebtedness as an alternative to cash, the authoritative Business Day newspaper said.     Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin told reporters yesterday the alternative proposal is designed to avoid an impasse when debt rescheduling talks reopen in New York on Tuesday.     He did not give details but said, "It is a very useful alternative and in the end will permit the banks to say that they achieved their pricing target and will likewise permit the Philippines to say exactly the same thing."     Quoting negotiation documents to be presented to the country"s 12-bank advisory committee, Business Day said the debt certificates will carry maturities of five or six years.     It said the certificates will be classified as zero-coupon bonds or promissory notes with no interest but priced at a considerable discount from their redemption price.     It said the debt bonds will entitle holder banks to a guaranteed return on both interest and principal since no payment of any kind is made until the bond matures.     It said a bank can sell the bonds on the secondary bond market for either dlrs or pesos depending on its requirement.     The documents said peso proceeds can be invested in selected industries under the Philippines" debt/equity program.     Ongpin said Manila is sticking to its demand of a spread of 5/8 percentage points over London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) for restructuring 3.6 billion dlrs of debt repayments.     "(The proposal) will give the banks a choice of 5/8ths or the alternative," Ongpin said. "Our representatives have gone to Washington to the (International Monetary) Fund, the (World) Bank, the Fed (Federal Reserve Board) and the (U.S.) Treasury to brief them in advance on this alternative and it has generally been positively received."     "We don"t believe that there is going to be a problem on the accounting side," Ongpin said. "We have run this alternative proposal to the accounting firms. Neither have the government regulators indicated that there will be a problem."  REUTER \\x03'

S'A majority of Americans disapprove of the way Ronald Reagan has handled the presidency and one-third believe he should resign, a new poll said.     The poll conducted by Newsweek magazine said 53 pct of the respondents gave Reagan a negative performance rating, nearly double his disapproval rating before the Iran/Contra scandal.     The magazine said, however, that Reagan remained personally popular. By better than a three-to-one ratio, a majority of those polled said they liked Reagan on a personal level.     And Newsweek said 52 per cent of those questioned believed the administration"s accomplishments outweighed its failures.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Talks on the possibility of reintroducing global coffee export quotas have been extended into today, with sparks flying yesterday when a dissident group of exporters was not included in a key negotiating forum.     The special meeting of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) council was called to find a way to stop a prolonged slide in coffee prices.     However, delegates said no solution to the question of how to implement quotas was yet in sight.     World coffee export quotas -- the major device used to regulate coffee prices under the International Coffee Agreement -- were suspended a year ago when prices soared in reaction to a drought which cut Brazil"s output by nearly two thirds.     Brazil is the world"s largest coffee producer and exporter.     Producers and consumers now are facing off over the question of how quotas should be calculated under any future quota distribution scheme, delegates said.     Tempers flared late Saturday when a minority group of eight producing countries was not represented in a contact group of five producer and five consumer delegates plus alternates which was set up to facilitate debate.     The big producers "want to have the ball only in their court and it isn"t fair," minority producer spokesman Luis Escalante of Costa Rica said.     The majority producer group has proposed resuming quotas April 1, using the previous ad hoc method of carving up quota shares, with a promise to try to negotiate basic quotas before September 30, delegates said.     Their plan would perpetuate the status quo, allowing Brazil to retain almost all of its current 30 pct share of the export market, Colombia 17 pct, Ivory Coast seven pct and Indonesia six pct, with the rest divided among smaller exporters.     But consuming countries and the dissident producer group have tabled separate proposals requiring quotas be determined by availability, using a formula incorporating exportable production and stocks statistics.     Their proposals would give Brazil a smaller quota share and Colombia and Indonesia a larger share, and bring a new quota distribution scheme into effect now rather than later.     Brazil has so far been unwilling to accept any proposal that would reduce its quota share, delegates said.     Delegates would not speculate on prospects for agreement on a quota package. "Anything is possible at this phase," even adjournment of the meeting until March or April, one said.     If the ICO does agree on quotas, the price of coffee on the supermarket shelf is not likely to change sinnificantly as a result, industry sources said.     Retail coffee prices over the past year have remained about steady even though coffee market prices have tumbled, so an upswing probably will not be passed onto the consumer either, they said.

S'Britain"s ruling Conservatives have enlarged their lead over the opposition Labour Party, according to results of two opinion polls released on Saturday.     A Market & Opinion Research International (MORI) poll conducted for The Sunday Times showed the Conservatives with a six point lead, while a poll by Telephone Surveys Limited for The Sunday Express found them to be four points ahead.     The Sunday Express poll is the first conducted since the Social Democratic Party scored an upset victory on Thursday in a parliamentary by-election in the former Labour stronghold of Greenwich, near London.     The MORI poll, conducted in the six days leading up to the by-election, showed the Conservatives with 41 pct of the vote, Labour with 35 pct and the Alliance of Social Democrats and Liberals with 21 pct.     The Sunday Express said its poll, conducted on Friday, found the Conservatives ahead with 35.6 pct of the vote, Labour with 31.9 pct and the Alliance with 31.4 pct.     A Harris poll published in The Observer newspaper last Sunday gave the Conservatives only a two-point lead over Labour. In that survey, the Conservatives had the support of 39 pct of the voters, Labour 37 pct and the Alliance 23 pct.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Indonesia"s agriculture sector will grow by just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987, against an estimated 2.4 pct in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or declines, the U.S. Embassy said in a report.     Production of Indonesia"s staple food, rice, is forecast to fall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of 26.58 mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report on Indonesia"s agricultural performance.     The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at 26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in 1987.     The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of a drawdown on stocks.     "Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or no gain," the report says.     "The modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oil and palm kernels."     Constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant seeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops, the report underlines.     The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as "wereng" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields.     The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, more resistant rice types.     The government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices.     Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pct in 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports rising to an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, the report says.     But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) will rise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports will also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant.     The report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybean meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last September"s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise in domestic demand.     The report said that Indonesia"s overall economic performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight negative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s. It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pct in 1984.     The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible for the slump.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Kuwait"s Oil Minister, in remarks published today, said there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in world oil prices.     Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local daily al-Qabas as saying: "None of the OPEC members has asked for such a meeting."     He denied Kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948,000 barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed production limits of the 13-nation organisation.     Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd agreed in Geneva last December.     They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above quota. Kuwait, they said, was pumping 1.2 mln bpd.     "This rumour is baseless. It is based on reports which said Kuwait has the ability to exceed its share. They suppose that because Kuwait has the ability, it will do so," the minister said.     Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability to produce up to 4.0 mln bpd.     "If we can sell more than our quota at official prices, while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their share, it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever," he said.     He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar, which industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpd of its 285,000 bpd quota, because buyers were resisting official prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a marker of 18 dlrs per barrel.     Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levels this year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of 19 dollars a barrel.     Sheikh Ali also delivered "a challenge to any international oil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices."     Because it was charging its official price, of 16.67 dlrs a barrel, it had lost custom, he said but did not elaborate.     However, Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil because of its local and international refining facilities and its own distribution network abroad, he added.     He reaffirmed that the planned meeting March 7 of OPEC"s differentials committee has been postponed until the start of April at the request of certain of the body"s members.     Ecuador"s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said last Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assign a lower official price for its crude, and was to seek this at talks this month of opec"s pricing committee.     Referring to pressure by oil companies on OPEC members, in apparent reference to difficulties faced by Qatar, he said: "We expected such pressure. It will continue through March and April." But he expected the situation would later improve.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Indonesia appears to be nearing a political crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected economy, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report.     To counter falling oil revenues, the government has launched a series of measures over the past nine months to boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new investment.     Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading primary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year"s fall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue its currency by 31 pct in September.     But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto"s government appears to be divided over what direction to lead the economy.     "(It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to deregulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports," the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia"s agricultural sector, but also reviews the country"s general economic performance.     It says that while many government officials and advisers are recommending further relaxation, "there are equally strong pressures being exerted to halt all such moves."     "This group strongly favours an import substitution economy," the report says.     Indonesia"s economic changes have been welcomed by the World Bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction, though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and steel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies.     Three sets of measures have been announced since last May, which broadened areas for foreign investment, reduced trade restrictions and liberalised imports.     The report says Indonesia"s economic growth in calendar 1986 was probably about zero, and the economy may even have contracted a bit. "This is the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s," the report notes.     Indonesia, the largest country in South-East Asia with a population of 168 million, is facing general elections in April.     But the report hold out little hope for swift improvement in the economic outlook. "For 1987 early indications point to a slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economic activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export earnings from the petroleum industry."     "Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, real declines in construction and trade, and a reduced level of growth in agriculture," the report states.     Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is crucial for the government to get the international lending its needs.     A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance of payments support was given partly to help the government maintain the momentum of reform, the Bank said.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Opposition politicians, businessmen and newspapers criticised India"s newly unveiled 1987/88 budget and large projected deficit of around 57 billion rupees.     They said the budget failed to provide incentives for economic growth and merely tinkered with tax reform.     But few politicians were prepared to criticise a sharp rise in defence expenditure in the Hindu-majority nation where playing on fear of aggression by Moslem Pakistan has proved a vote winner. The Indian Express, the country"s biggest selling paper, said: "The defence cow has never been holier."     The Sunday Mail newspaper branded the budget "shamelessly political." It said in a front page commentary the "budget is bad for growth, bad for prices, bad for the stock market and neutral in respect of everything else."     Businessmen polled by Reuters said the budget had done little for them.     Gandhi announced small increases in poverty alleviation and education outlays but he ordered a hold-down on current expenditure in an attempt to rein in the budget deficit. He told ministries to curb spending and promised a review of money-losing public sector industries.     Gandhi lowered import tariffs on some computer parts but otherwise did little to extended the economic liberalisation policy launched two years ago.     Reaction in Bombay, India"s business capital, was generally unfavourable.     Businessmen and economists said the budget had no proposals for closing the 1987/88 budget deficit. It also failed to boost industrial investment and productivity needed to lift real economic growth above the five pct a year envisaged by the 1985-90 development plan.     Nalin Vissanji, President of the Indian Merchants Chambers of Commerce said the budget gave no incentives to the capital market and had not fulfilled a government pledge to remove surtax on corporate income.     Shares on The Bombay Stock Exchange, India"s biggest, fell in a post-budget session yesterday but brokers welcomed Gandhi"s proposal to set up a regulatory board for the securities industry.     The exchange was shaken last year by several scandals and trading was suspended several times.     Brokers said trading volume may increase with the change in capital gains tax on stock sales.     Stockholders can now sell shares after one year instead of three years without incurring capital gains tax.     Stock Exchange President Ramdas Dalal said yesterday the fall in share prices after the budget came as profits were taken and he expected to the market to firm in days to come.  REUTER \\x03'

S'The Philippines will offer its commercial bank creditors an innovative pricing plan that will make debt payments through certificates of indebtedness as an alternative to cash, the authoritative Business Day newspaper said.     Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin told reporters yesterday the alternative proposal is designed to avoid an impasse when debt rescheduling talks reopen in New York on Tuesday.     He did not give details but said, "It is a very useful alternative and in the end will permit the banks to say that they achieved their pricing target and will likewise permit the Philippines to say exactly the same thing."     Quoting negotiation documents to be "presented to the country\'s 12-bank advisory committee, Business Day" said the debt certificates will carry maturities of five or six years.     It said the certificates will be classified as zero-coupon bonds or promissory notes with no interest but priced at a considerable discount from their redemption price.     It said the debt bonds will entitle holder banks to a guaranteed return on both interest and principal since no payment of any kind is made until the bond matures.     It said a bank can sell the bonds on the secondary bond market for either dlrs or pesos depending on its requirement.     The documents said peso proceeds can be invested in selected in"dustries under the Philippines\' debt/equity program.     Ongpin sai"d Manila is sticking to its demand of a spread of 5/8 percentage points over London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) for restructuring 3.6 billion dlrs of debt repayments.     "(The proposal) will give the banks a choice of 5/8ths or the alternative," Ongpin said. "Our representatives have gone to Washington to the (International Monetary) Fund, the (World) Bank, the Fed (Federal Reserve Board) and the (U.S.) Treasury to brief them in advance on this alternative and it has generally been positively received."     "We don\\\'t believe that there is going to be a problem on the accounting side," Ongpin said. "We have run this alternative proposal to the accounting firms. Neither have the government regulators indicated that there will be a problem."  REUTER \\x03'

S'"Saudi riyal interbank deposits were steady at yesterday\'s higher le"vels in a quiet market.     Traders said they were reluctant to take out new positions amidst uncertainty over whether OPEC will succeed in halting the current decline in oil prices.     Oil industry sources said yesterday several Gulf Arab producers had had difficulty selling oil at official OPEC prices but Kuwait has said there are no plans for an emergency meeting of the 13-member organisation.     A traditional Sunday lull in trading due to the European weekend also contributed to the lack of market activity.     Spot-next and one-week rates were put at 6-1/4, 5-3/4 pct after quotes ranging between seven, six yesterday.     One, three, and six-month deposits were quoted unchanged at 6-5/8, 3/8, 7-1/8, 6-7/8 and 7-3/8, 1/8 pct respectively.

S'Bangladesh police mounted a cross-country hunt for defaulters on bank loans, arresting four industrialists and issuing arrest warrants against 50 others for failure to repay overdue obligations. No names were given.     Metropolitan police told reporters the four arrested, put under six month pre-trial detention, owed nearly 50.7 mln taka -- the equivalent of about 1.7 mln dlrs -- to Bangladesh Shilpa (Industrial) Bank.     President Hossain Mohammad Ershad has said non-payers are crippling the industrial sector. But the Chamber of Commerce and industry said the crackdown would scare away entrepreneurs.  REUTER \\x03'

S'"The Gulf oil state of Qatar, recovering slightly from last year\'s d"ecline in world oil prices, announced its first budget since early 1985 and projected a deficit of 5.472 billion riyals.     The deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyals in the last published budget for 1985/86.     In a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year 1987/88 beginning today, Finance and Petroleum Minister Sheikh Abdul-Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani said the government expected to spend 12.217 billion riyals in the period.     Projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6 billion riyals.     Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said government revenue would be about 6.745 billion riyals, down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86 projected revenue of 9.7 billion.     The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to uncertainty surrounding oil revenues.     Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said that during that year the government decided to limit recurrent expenditure each month to one-twelfth of the previous fi"scal year\'s allocations minus 15 pct.     He urged heads of govern"ment departments and public institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. He did not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered.     Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said plans to limit expenditure in 1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden pl"aced on the country\'s foreign reserves.     He added in 1987/88 so"me 2.766 billion riyals had been allocated for major projects including housing and public buildings, social services, health, education, transport and communications, electricity and water, industry and agriculture.     No figure was revealed for expenditure on defence and security. There was also no projection for oil revenue.     Qatar, an OPEC member, has an output ceiling of 285,000 barrels per day.     Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said: "Our expectations of positive s"igns regarding (oil) price trends, foremost among them OPEC\'s dete"rmination to shoulder its responsibilites and protect its wealth, h"ave helped us make reasonable estimates for the coming year\'s reven"ue on the basis of our assigned quota."

S'Gulf money markets have grown reasonably well during the past decade, but bond and stock markets remain to a large extent fragmented and lag behind, <Gulf International Bank BSC> (GIB) said.     The b"ank\'s economist Henry Azzam said in a review of Gulf capital market"s that investors have to relinquish traditional investment vehicles such as real estate, foreign currency bank accounts and precious metals.     "Greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with more diversified capital market instruments and a change in the disclosure requirements on company accounts," he said.     The GIB study reviewed capital markets under three categories -- money markets, stock and bond markets.     Azzam said Gulf states had been making greater use of short-term money market instruments and banks in the region had floated various euronotes and underwriting facilities.     "Nevertheless, bond and stock markets remain, to a large extent, fragmented and lagging behind," he said.     Most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans and bank facilities and very few companies had made use of stock or bond issues. Only Kuwait has an official stock exchange, while other Gulf nations have yet to establish exchanges.     But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf, governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital markets and set up domestic stock exchanges, Azzam said.     He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had "clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital markets in the region."     In addition, family firms are reluctant to go public, financial awareness among investors is still lacking and investment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack depth. A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted investors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery.     Azzam said the absen"ce of proper commercial law in some Gulf countries and authorities\'" apparent reluctance to adopt financial innovations had also hampered capital markets.     He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation of joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments.     Azzam said capital market instruments should be made available to all citizens and institutions of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some moves had been taken in this direction, with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals to own up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies.     Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depth from the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain and the expansion of securities repurchase regulations in Saudi Arabia.     But he added there is "no bond market to speak of" in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman or the UAE, with the last Saudi riyal denominated bond issued in 1978.     While Bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading in Saudi Arabia has picked up, establishment of formal exchanges in Qatar, Oman and the UAE does not appear imminent, Azzam said.

S'"Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer reiterated the kingdom\'s co""mmitment to last December\'s OPEC accord to boost world oil prices a"nd stabilise the market, the official Saudi Press Agency SPA said.     Asked by the agency about the recent fall in free market oil prices, Nazer said Saudi Arabia "is fully adhering by the ... Accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the pronounced prices under any circumstance."     Nazer, quoted by SPA, said recent pressure on free market prices "may be because of the end of the (northern hemisphere) winter season and the glut in the market."     Saudi Arabia was a main architect of the December accord, under which OPEC agreed to lower its total output ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) and return to fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.     The agreement followed a year of turmoil on oil markets, which saw prices slump briefly to under 10 dlrs a barrel in mid-1986 from about 30 dlrs in late 1985. Free market prices are currently just over 16 dlrs.     Nazer was quoted by the SPA as sa"ying Saudi Arabia\'s adherence to the accord was shown clearly in th"e oil market.     He said contacts among members of OPEC showed they all wanted to stick to the accord.     In Jamaica, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, who is also Nigerian Oil Minister, said the group planned to stick with the pricing agreement.     "We are aware of the negative forces trying to manipulate the operations of the market, but we are satisfied that the fundamentals exist for stable market conditions," he said.     Kuwait\\\'s Oil Minister, Sheikh Ali a"l-Khalifa al-Sabah, said in remarks published in the emirate\'s dail"y Al-Qabas there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review prices.     Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above the 15.8 mln ceiling.     They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above quota. Sheikh Ali denied that Kuwait was over-producing.  REUTER \\x03'

S'The International Coffee Organization (ICO ) council talks on reintroducing export quotas continued with an extended session lasting late into Sunday night, but delegates said prospects for an accord between producers and consumers were diminishing by the minute.     The special meeting, called to stop the prolonged slide in coffee prices, was likely to adjourn sometime tonight without agreement, delegates said.     The council is expected to agree to reconvene either within the next six weeks or in September, they said.     The talks foundered on Sunday afternoon when it became apparent consumers and producers could not compromise on the formula for calculating any future quota system, delegates said.     Coffee export quotas were suspended a year ago when prices soared in response to a dr"ought which cut Brazil\'s crop by nearly two-thirds. Brazil is the w""orld\'s largest coffee producer and exporter.  REUTER \\x03"'

It said in a statement it forecasts a net cash withdrawal from the system over the settlement week. Cash flows to the government are expected to more than offset cash injections, it added.     The bank said it expects to conduct open market operations during the week and after these, cash balances should fluctuate around 30 mln N.Z. Dlrs.  REUTER \\x03'

S'The U.S. Economy continued to expand in February but at a slower pace than in January, which saw a spurt of activity, the National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) said in a report.     The" Association\'s composite survey index dropped to 51.9 pct in Februa"ry from 55.8 pct in January, the NAPM said. It was the seventh consecutive month in which this leading indicator was over 50 pct.     A reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economy is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a declining economy.     The  NAPM report, based on a survey of purchasing managers at 250 U.S. Industrial companies, also found that the growth rate in new orders and production slowed in February.     But production remained vigorous, with more than three times as many members reporting it better rather than worse.     Vendor deliveries improved slightly last month, but members reported that steel supplies were tight as USX Corp gradually resumed production.     The same number of members reported inventories were higher as reported them lower. The NAPM said that had not happened since August 1984.     For a sixth straight month, more purchasers reported paying higher rather than lower prices, this time by a ratio of nine to one.     Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM\\\'s business survey committee, said: "The economy continued to expand in February, but at a more subdued rate than in January. The slowing of new orders should not be significant enough to dampen prospects for a respectable first quarter."     The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, based on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders, production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Canadian and Egyptian wheat negotiators failed to conclude an agreement on Canadian wheat exports to Egypt during talks last week, but the Canadian team will return to Cairo for further negotiations, Canadian embassy officials said.     An embassy official declined to identify which issues remained to be resolved and when the talks would resume.     In a five-year protocol signed in 1985, Cairo agreed to purchase 500,000 tonnes of Canadian wheat a year.  REUTER \\x03'

It forecast end-1987 stocks at around 290,000 tonnes.     The main suppliers in 1986 were Australia (44 pct), the U.S. (29 pct), Canada (12 pct), Argentina (8 pct) and Saudi Arabia (5 pct).

S'Zambia will retain its foreign-exchange auction system despite the suspension of weekly auctions since January 24, President Kenneth Kaunda said.     "We have not run away from the auction. It hasn\\\'t been abolished at all," he told Reuters in an interview.     He said the system would be reintroduced after current talks with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and, he hoped, would be backed by fresh foreign aid funds.     Kaunda dismissed central bank statements the new auction system would be used to allocate foreign exchange to private bidders but not to fix the exchange rate.     Kaunda said the auction system had faltered because of the gove"rnment\'s shortage of foreign exchange to meet demand.     It was su""spended when the kwacha\'s rapid devaluation and strong fluctuations" made economic planning almost impossible for the government and the private sector, he said.     Weekly foreign-exchange auctions began in October 1985. The kwacha fell from 2.20 to the dollar to about 15 in 16 months. In January 1987 the government was more than two months in arrears in paying foreign currency to successful bidders, and the auction was suspended and replaced with a fixed exchange rate of nine kwacha to the dollar.

S'"Poland\'s talks in Washington with the World Bank and the Internatio""nal Monetary Fund (IMF) on the country\'s 33.5 billion dlr foreign d"ebt were concrete, open and frank, a senior Polish banker was quote"d as saying.     Wladyslaw Baka, head of Poland\'s National Bank, to"ld the official news agency PAP yesterday the talks were a step towards possible fresh credits or easier terms.     "Much attention was given to the Polish delegation and the talks at both institution"s involved displayed a lot of understanding for Poland\'s difficult "economic position," PAP quoted Baka as saying.     Baka said he stressed Poland would meet its financial obligations to the U.S., "but not in a short time, and not without major changes in the Polish economy as well as a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners."     Since Poland rejoined the IMF last June, after a 36-year absence, IMF and World Bank teams have visited Warsaw on fact-finding missions on at least three occasions. A major report is expected to be issued in Washington soon.     Poland has said it will not be able to meet interest repayments and debt principle falling due this year.  REUTER \\x03'

S'"Indonesia\'s raw sugar output is likely to be 1.8 mln tonnes in cale""ndar 1987, unchanged from 1986 and below the government\'s 1987 fore"cast of 2.5 mln, the U.S. Embassy said in its agricultural outlook for 1987.     Indonesia bought 162,500 tonnes of raw sugar on world markets in late 1986, the report said.     The embassy estimated "Indonesia\'s calendar 1986 raw sugar production at 1.8 mln tonnes, a"gainst a government estimate of 1.99 mln.     It said that Indones"ia\'s move into sugar self-sufficiency in 1984 may have been short-l"ived.     The report said, "The government continues to promote sugarcane production through its smallholder intensification program and a relatively high guaranteed price to sugarcane producers.     "However, there are considerable indications that farmers are reluctant to plant cane because its economic return is not as good as that of other crops."  REUTER \\x03'

S'European Community (EC) agriculture ministers meet later today to consider a package of deep cuts in prices and subsidies after a week marked by strong protests by European farmers, Community officials" said.     The common target for the farmers\' wrath is the EC\'s Br"ussels Commission, which for the fourth year running has called for radical changes in the price support system.     EC Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen says huge food surpluses, which have alienated international trade partners and pushed the Community to the edge of bankruptcy, demand such action.     With Community warehouses stocked with some 16 mln tonnes of unwanted cereals, over one mln tonnes of butter and huge stocks of wine and olive oil, Andriessen says bluntly the days of open-ended price guarantees must end.     EC agriculture ministers try to fix the guaranteed prices paid to Community farmers before an April 1 deadline for the new marketing year, an increasingly difficult task as EC members cut funds and demand greater budget discipline.     Andriessen has proposed a freeze for most prices, coupled with reductions in other support mechanisms, which could lead to price cuts of as much as eight pct fo"r some products.     A producer\'s right to sell into EC warehouses "at a fixed guaranteed price when he finds no real market outlet is to be scaled back so it applies only in exceptional cases.     The latest proposals are designed to keep expenditure on agriculture virtually stable. EC farm policies now swallow two-thirds of an annual budget of about 36 billion European currency units (Ecu) and are mainly responsible for an expected shortfall this year of about five billion Ecus.     The most contentious aspects of the package are a new oils and fats tax and a change in the "green" exchange rate system, which translates EC farm prices into national currencies.     The tax, of up to 330 Ecus per tonne, would be levied on imported and domestically produced oilseeds, but could trigger a fresh trade dispute with the United States, which provides the EC with the bulk of its soybeans.     It would increase the cost of margarines and low-fat products in an attempt to increase both olive oil and butter consumption.     West Germany has flatly rejected green rate changes, which would cause a fall in prices for producers as countries with weak and strong currencies were brought more into line.  REUTER \\x03'

S'<Qantas Airways Ltd> has placed a firm order with Boeing Co <BA> for four 747-400 aircraft at a cost of 250 mln Australian dlrs each, chairman Jim Leslie said.     The first is due for delivery in April 1989 with the others arriving in May, June and September of that year, he said in a statement.     The 400 series is the latest model of the Boeing 747 family, he said.     The purchase will take g"overnment-owned Qantas\'s 747 fleet to 28, he said.     Leslie said" Qantas is talking to three engine makers who are all offering engines for the Boeing 747-400 and it will announce a decision on engine purchases later this year.     He said they are United Technologies Corp <UTX> unit <Pratt^M and Whitney>, General Electric Co <GE> "and Britain\'s <Rolls-Royce^M  Ltd>.     He said the 747-400, which" incorporates new technology such as extended wings with six-feet high winglets and enhanced electronics, should have its first flight next February. The 400 series has a designed range of 12,500 kms, "2,140 kms further than the current Qantas 747-300\'s, he said.     "The aircraft will be financed by foreign borrowings and foreign exchange earnings, and Qantas believes they will pay for themselves in four to five years, Leslie said.     The 747-400 has a take-off weight of 870,000 pounds, up from 833,000 for the 300 series, and offers an eight pct fuel saving, he said.     The higher range and payload means they will first be used on the route to Britain and Europe via Asia.     They will also be used on non-stop flights between Sydney and Los Angeles.  REUTER \\x03'

S'American Express Co <AXP>, rumoured to be considering a spinoff of part of <Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc>, said it is studying ways to" improve Shearson\'s access to capital and help it meet stiffer inte"rnational competition.     In a joint statement, American Express and the brokerage unit said the actions under consideration are an i"ntegral part of American Express\'s worldwide financial services str"ategy. The statement also said American Express and Shearson have been having both internal and external discussions on the matter, but no final decision has been reached.     American Express said in its statement it would not comment on the rumours circulating on Wall Street last week.     Analysts said there was speculation that American Express would sell a stake of Shearson to a Japanese firm and also that 20 pct of the profitable brokerage would be sold to t"he public. Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express\'s "1.25 billion dlrs net in 1986.     American Express remained silent last Thursday and Friday as rumours drove its stock up a total of 5.50 dlrs in two days. It closed Friday at 74.  REUTER \\x03'

S'An earthquake measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale caused widespread damage in northern New Zealand and a civil defence emergency was declared in some areas, officials and seismologists said.     There were no immediate reports of casualties. The quake jolted the Bay of Plenty and Waikato areas.     The town of Whakatane was said by officials to be virtually isolated.     A civil defence emergency was declared in Whakatane which has about 16,000 people. Officials said many roads and bridges in the area had been damaged.     No deaths were reported but one man was admitted to hospital in serious condition after his car was buried in a mud slip.     Seismologists said Whakatane was hit by three earthquakes, the strongest measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale. They were followed by a series of aftershocks.     The quakes were felt across the Bay of Plenty and Waikato regions in the northeast of the North Island.     Smaller tremors had been felt in the Bay of Plenty for more than a week.     Police said many districts lost power supplies and telephone links.     Energy Ministry officials ordered the release of water behind the Matahina hydro-electric dam, 32 kilometres above Whakatane on the Rangitaiki river. The quake cracked the roadway and concrete abutment along the top of Matahina, the largest earth dam in the North Island.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Philippine Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin starts negotiations with "the country\'s 12-bank advisory committee in New York tomorrow, buoy"ed by an economy on the mend and political stability one year after President Corazon Aquino took power, central bank officials said.     The country now has foreign debt totalling 27.8 billion dlrs and faces debt repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs due between January 1987 and December 1992. Manila also hopes to tack on another 5.8 billion dlrs, rescheduled in a 1985 accord, to any new agreement, the of"ficials said.     Chile\'s 15-1/2 year rescheduling accord at one pe"rcentage point over London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) and Ven"ezuala\'s 21 billion dlr package at 7/8 point over LIBOR portend wel""l for the Philippines, despite Brazil\'s repayment suspension last w"eek, the officials said.     Manila, which has not made any principal repayments since 1983, wants terms better than the 20-year repayments at 13/16 percentage point over LIBOR offered in October to Mexico in a 77 billion dlr rescue.     Ongpin wants 5/8 point over the benchmark rate, which is currently hovering around 6-1/2 pct.     The banks are said to be firm on the 1-1/8 points offered when the last round of negotiations collapsed on November 7.     Ongpin said every 1/16 point over LIBOR meant an additional 5.1 mln dlrs in annual interest payments.     One banker said banks were wary of repeating a Mexico-type accord, which some 70 small creditor banks are still refusing to endorse five months after it was signed.     "In Manila\'s case, about 40 pct of the 15 billion dlrs outstanding t"o commercial banks is owed to the 12 large banks on the advisory committee, while about 180 smaller banks have average exposures of 20 mln dlrs each.

S'Saudi crude oil output last month fell to an average of 3.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 3.8 mln bpd in January, Gulf oil sources sa"id.     They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju\'aymah termin"als in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last month from 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by some customers.     But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf exports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said.     The production figures include neutral zone output but not sales from floating storage, which are g"enerally considered part of a country\'s output for Opec purposes. "    Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a production restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group last December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel.     The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February entitlements before" the month-end.     Last week\'s high export levels appeared to show"" continued support for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia\'s mai"n crude customers, the four ex-partners of Aramco, the sources said.     The four -- Exxon Corp <XON>, Mobil Corp <MOB>, Texaco Inc <TX> and Chevron Corp <CHV> -- signed a long-term agreement last month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel.     However the sour"ces said the real test of Saudi Arabia\'s ability to sell crude at o"fficial prices in a weak market will come this month, when demand for petroleum products traditionally tapers off. Spot prices have fallen in recent weeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels.     Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday reiterated the kin"gdom\'s commitment to the December OPEC accord and said it would nev"er sell below official prices.     The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell slightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in January because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export refineries.     They put crude oil exports through Yanbu at 100,000 bpd last month, compared to zero in January, while throughp"ut at Bahrain\'s refinery and neutral zone production remained stead"y at around 200,000 bpd each.

S'"Indonesia\'s palm oil output is expected to rise and exports to incr""ease, the U.S. Embassy said in its annual report on Indonesia\'s agr"iculture sector.     The Indonesian government said crude palm oil (CPO) output is expected to rise to 1.56 mln tonnes in 1987 and 2.11 mln in 1988, up from a projected 1.45 mln tonnes in 1986 and 1.26 mln in 1985.     The 1986 projection of 1.45 mln tonnes is up from a provisional figure of 1.3 mln tonnes.     A U.S. Embassy assessment puts 1987 output at 1.45 mln tonnes, against 1.35 mln in 1986 and 1.208 mln in 1985.     "More realistic estimates indicate that 1988 production will be between 1.5 and 1.6 mln tonnes," the report said.     The report said the abolition of the five pct CPO export tax, the devaluation of the rupiah in September 1986 and higher international palm oil prices should lead to a modest increase in exports this year.     Exports are forecast to rise to 720,000 tonnes against 695,000 tonnes in 1986, the report added.  REUTER \\x03'

S'"Indonesia\'s exports of tea and cocoa will continue to rise in calen"dar 1987 but coffee exports are forecast to dip slightly in 1987/88 (April-March) as the government tries to improve quality, the U.S." Embassy said.     The embassy\'s annual report on Indonesian agricu"lture forecast coffee output in 1986/87 would be 5.77 mln bags of 60 kilograms each. That is slightly less than the 5.8 mln bags produced in 1985/86.     In 1987/88 coffee production is forecast to rise again to 5.8 mln bags, but exports to dip to 4.8 mln from around 5.0 mln in 1986/87. Exports in 1985/86 were 4.67 mln bags.     The embassy report says coffee stocks will rise to 1.3 mln tonnes in 1987/88 from 1.15 mln in 1986/87. It bases this on a fall in exports as a result of the "probable" re-introduction of quotas by the International Coffee Organisation.     Cocoa production and exports are forecast to rise steadily as the government develops cocoa plantations. Production of cocoa in Indonesia increased to 32,378 tonnes in calendar 1985 from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. It is projected by the government to rise to more than 50,000 tonnes by 1988.     Production in 1986 is estimated by the embassy at 35,000 tonnes, as against 38,000 tonnes in 1987.     The report forecasts cocoa exports to rise to 35,000 tonnes this year, from 33,000 tonnes in 1986 and 31,000 in 1985.     The Netherlands is at present the biggest importer of Indonesian cocoa beans.     The report forecasts that in cal"endar 1987, Indonesia\'s CTC (crushed, torn and curled) tea exports "will increase significantly with the coming on stream of at least eight new CTC processing plants.     Indonesia plans to diversify its tea products by producing more CTC tea, the main component of tea bags.     Production of black and green teas is forecast in the embassy report to rise to 125,000 tonnes in calendar 1987 from 123,000 tonnes in 1986.     Exports of these teas are likely to rise to 95,000 tonnes in 1987 from 85,000 in 1986 and around 90,000 in 1985.     The embassy noted the ministry of trade tightened quality controls on tea in October 1986 in an effort to become more competititve in the world market.  REUTER \\x03'

S'The Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) plans to introduce electronic trading of shares listed on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System (NASDAQ) in the U.S. And on Lon"don\'s Stock Exchange Automated Quotation System, banking sources sa"id.     The SES is discussing the idea with the London and New York authorities. Gordon Macklin, president of the National Association of Securities Dealers in Washington, said he was very optimistic about an early agreement, possibly by the end of this month.     Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) sources told Reuters they supported the proposed linking of computer trading systems on the three exchanges, and the banking sources said local financial support for the plan existed.     Macklin said if an agreement were reached it would move the three exchanges towards 24-hour trading, with Singapore filling a gap when no trading takes place.     A small group of selected stocks would be used at the start of three-centre trading to determine investor interest.     The Singapore, London and New York authorities have agreed in principle on how the three exchanges would trade and transfer information among the different time zones, but some details still have to be worked out, a senior Singapore bank director said.     Questions remain concerning investor willingness to deploy sufficient capital in Singapore to ensure adequate market liquidity and communication links to the other three centres.     But if agreement is reached, Singapore will have a head start over the other Asian financial centres in Hong Kong, Toyko and Australia, he said.     On February 18 the SES created the Stock Exchange of Singapore Dealing and Automated Quotation System (SESDAQ), modelled on NASDAQ.     At present SESDAQ is trading the shares of only one company, the government-owned Singapore National Printers Ltd (SNP), but its turnover has been fairly active, and other small firms have said they plan to seek listings soon.     Market sources expect the next few companies listed will also be government-owned entities, which would have no problem meeting the listing conditions. Approval for a listing of Trans-Island Bus Service Pte Ltd is expected soon, they said.     SNP, previously wholly-owned "by the government\'s Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd, issued seven mln 50"-cent shares at one dlr each last month in a public offering oversubscribed 119 times.     In SESDAQ trading, SNP shares have advanced from an initial 1.87 dlrs to a Friday close of 2.32 after a 2.80 high. So far more than 900,000 shares have traded.  REUTER \\x03'

S'After an onslaught of new paper, fewer mark eurobonds issues are expected this week, bankers said.     Most managers said they were pl"anning a low issue volume for the Bundesbank\'s two-week bond calend"ar beginning today.     "We want to have a week\\\'s pause," one manager said.     Last week borrowings totalled 1.775 billion marks, including a 300 mln mark private placement for Deutsche Bank. Issues for all of February rose to nearly five billion marks, from 3.6 billion in January.     The heavy volume also meant most borrowers except the very best addresses were having to accept higher coupons.     "I think the D-mark market is still good, but only if you can give a good coupon," another manager said.     But even some government borrowers were not getting the best reception for bonds which would have been taken up more readily under other conditions.     Of the three mark eurobonds launched on Tuesday alone, bonds for Den Danske Bank and Iceland were trading outside fees on Friday, altho"ugh prices had recovered from initial lows.     Den Danske\'s 5-3/4 "1992 bond was quoted at midday on Friday at 97.35/65 compared with "its par price, and Iceland\'s 6-1/2 pct 1997 bond traded at 97.25/75" against a 100-1/4 issue price.     A 300 mln mark 6-1/8 pct 1997 issue for Nippon Telegraph and Telephone was also depressed, but traded Friday within fees at 98.15, 98.50 from its par price.     Some shorter maturities did better. In contrast to the 10-year NTT and Iceland issues, a five-year six pct bond for Hoogovens, traded at 98.40/75 from its 99-1/2 price, thanks mainly to its shorter maturity, dealers said.     The large amount of paper brought to the market in the last two months has also led many syndicate managers to c"omplain about the Bundesbank\'s present fixed calendar system, which" they say is too inflexible.     Currently all mark denominated eurobonds have to be registered with the Bundesbank in the week preceding the two-week issue period. A bank may decline to issue a bond on the requested day in the calendar, but then has to wait for the next calendar period to schedule the bond again.     Some managers said they would prefer to abolish the system.     The Bundesbank shortened the reporting period to two weeks from four weeks last July. But few expect the calendar to be completely abolished. "I don\\\'t think the Bundesbank would give that up," one banking analyst said.     "I wouldn\\\'t have anything against getting rid of the system," the analyst said, adding banks were capable of regulating the volume of new issues themselves.     The Bundesbank plays a passive role in setting the calendar without trying to regulate the issues, but it needs the registration to gauge the volume of mark bonds going through the euromarket, he said.     For this reason, few managers here foresee the Bundesbank sacrificing its present calendar system.     Bond activity in West German bond trading and syndication departments is also expected to be quieter than normal owing to the carnival holiday.     Carnival will close banks in Duesseldorf all day on Monday. In Frankfurt, banks will close on Tuesday in the afternoon.  REUTER \\x03'

S'<Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp> (NTT) expects its profits to fall to 328 billion yen in the year ending March 31, 1988 from a projected 348 billion this year, the company said.     Total sales for the same period are expected to rise to 5,506 billion yen from a projected 5,328 billion this year, NTT said in a business operations plan submitted to the Post and Telecommunications Ministry.     NTT said it plans to make capital investments of 1,770 billion yen in 1987/88, including 109 billion for research and development, as against a total of 1,600 billion this year.     An NTT spokesman said increased competition from new entrants to the telecommunications field and the effect of a sales tax scheduled to be introduced next January, were the major factors behind the projected decrease in profits.     The Japanese telecommunications industry was deregulated in 1985.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Thai Airways International plans to expand its fleet to 58 from 30 aircraft by 1995, company officials said.     Thamnoon Wanglee, vice-president for finance, told a weekend marketing conference Thai would finance the expansion by borrowing, but he did not give details.     He said the airline planned to reduce its yen borrowing to 36.4 pct of overall debt by September 1992. It is currently 64.3 pct of overall debt.     He said dollar borrowing should rise to 56.2 pct of overall debt in the same period, compared to 15.7 pct now.     Other company officials said the state-owned airline had no plans to go private. They said the airline is studying a government proposal for it to merge with Thai Airways Company, the state-owned domestic carrier.     A report presented to the conference showed the airline expects passenger sales revenue to be 13 pct higher in 1987 than in 1986. This follows a 20 pct jump in passenger sales revenue in the past four months.     Executive vice president Chatrachai Bunya-ananta said the current expansion of Bangkok airport would be completed this year.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Iraq has secured agreement to defer outstanding payments on a 500 mln dlr syndicated euroloan following five months of negotiations with creditor banks.     Banking sources said the rescheduling is par"t of Iraq\'s continuing effort to defer payments of foreign debt as "its economy comes under strain from the  Gulf War and soft world oil prices.     Iraq informed the 37 banks in the loan syndicate last September it could not meet the remaining four principal repayments totalling 285 mln dlrs, and missed the first of these for 71.25 mln due on September 29.     The 500 mln dlr credit, under the lead management of Paris-based Union de Banques Arabes et Francaises (UBAF), has a five-year maturity and a margin of one percentage point over London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR).     Banking sources said the agreement now worked out goes some way to meeting creditor bank demands that at least part of the first missing instalment of 71.25 mln dlrs be paid and not deferred.     One quarter or 17.8 mln dlrs will be paid on signature of the accord, expected in late March, with the remainder in three more instalments to be made every six months.     The remaining three principal instalments - originally due in March 1987, September 1987 and March 1988 - will each be deferred for two years from the due date, banking sources said.     The margin for the loan remains unchanged and no penalty interest is being imposed, the sources added.     Bank reaction to Iraq"\'s rescheduling request has been one of resignation, with many bank""ers seeing little alternative for Baghdad\'s economic planners. Iraq" is estimated to have foreign debt of about 50 billion dlrs, although about half is thought to be in the form of loans from its Gulf Arab allies, particularly Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.     The 500 mln dlr credit is in the name of the state-owned Rafidain Bank. The only other major eurocredit, a 500 mln dlr deal under the agency of Gulf International Bank, was signed in October, 1985 and is still in "a two year grace period.     The bulk of Iraq\'s commercial debt - e"xcluding loans by its allies in the Gulf War - is in the form of trade financing.     But Rafidain bank stopped paying debt due on letters of credit last March and a series of negotiations with banks and western government export credit agencies has been underway. Some banks have agreed to a three-year deferrment of obligations due on letters of credit.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Talks on coffee export quotas at the International Coffee Organization (ICO) special council session will resume at noon gmt today, following a last minute decision taken early this morning to extend the meeting 24 hours, ICO officials said.     An 18 member contact group will meet at midday to examine new ideas, and the full council is to convene at 1900gmt, they said.     The extension resulted from a last ditch effort by Colombia to salvage the talks, which by late yesterday looked perilously close to ending without agreement on quotas, delegates said.  REUTER \\x03'

S'"China\'s state and collective firms do not have enough cash to opera"te imported equipment, so banks will issue more bonds to raise funds, a Chinese bank official was quoted by the China Daily as saying.     Xie was quoted as saying the present cash shortage means some state firms do not run at full capacity and are inefficient. The central government does not have enough money to meet their needs.     The paper said, "Reliable sources disclosed that the country is running a budget deficit." It gave no figure.     Xie said her bank sooner or later will have to punish the many firms that have failed to repay loans made to them over the past two years at high interest rates. The bank financed the loans by issuing two billion yuan of bonds, but she gave no other details.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Japanese securities houses will issue new corporate bonds more quickly, accept issue requests throughout the month instead of at month-end and introduce a competitive underwriting method from April 1, to bring Japanese firms back to the Tokyo bond market, securities managers said.     Domestic issues have slowed to a trickle as more and more companies turn to more flexible overseas markets for cash, but the proposed moves are expected to pave the way for a review of public bond issues, they said.     "Relaxation of issue rules would be better applied not only to straight corporate bonds, but also convertible bonds and warrant bonds, to call back issuers effectively from overseas markets," a Nikko Securities house bond manager said.     Securities houses will launch an issue about 10 days after a corporate declaration of intent instead of 25 days as now, the securities managers said.     Underwriters are expected to abolish the lump-sum issuance system, in which all corporate bonds are issued at month-end, and accept issue requests during the month, they said.     Securities houses also plan to introduce free competition among underwriters when negotiating with issuers over terms in order to better reflect the market, securities managers said.     Market participants expect the new issue methods to be applied beginning in April, with the projected issue by <Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp>.     The so-called proposal method abolishes the practice of taking lead-managership and enables more market-oriented decisions on terms, securities sources said.     The four major Japanese securities houses now take turns underwriting corporate bonds.     Setting issue terms using financial criteria prepared by securities houses and in reference to coupon rates on latest public bonds is now almost automatic, they said.     The new moves are based on wide-ranging proposals made in late December by advisers to Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. They were aimed at revitalising the domestic corporate bond market, securities house managers said.     The finance ministry, commissioned banks and securities houses agreed in January to lower the eligibility ceiling for companies wanting to issue non-collateral straight and convertible bonds from March 1, securities managers said.     The cut will more than double the number of corporations able to make non-collateral issues from around 70 for straight bonds and 180 for convertibles now, securities managers said.     The Bond Market Committee of the Securities Exchange Council also recommended introduction of a shelf registration system, more use of corporate ratings systems and simplification of disclosure rules to help speed up the issuing process, securities sources said.     It also called for a major review of the commissioned bank system, which increases the cost of issuing domestic bonds, and for deregulation of private placements, they said.     Some of these proposals are likely to take some time to put into effect, the sources said. A shelf registration system would need a revision of Japanese commercial law, expected in 1988, the sources said.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Japanese importers bought some 95,000 tonnes of Chinese soybeans late last month for May to September shipment, under the semi-annual trade accords, trade sources said.     The FOB premium rose to 13.50 dlrs per tonne, up 2.50 dlrs from the premium for the November to April shipment, but down from 13.80 for the last May to September shipment.     Flat prices for Chinese beans are based on futures prices in Chicago plus the FOB premium.     Japanese purchases of Chinese soybeans, including spot buying, may have totalled 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes of the 1986 crop for November to April 1987 shipment, down from some 300,000 tonnes the previous year, the sources said.     Domestic demand for edible-use soybeans is expected to remain stable at about 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes a year, the sources said.     In recent years Japanese importers have overbought Chinese edible-use soybeans and sold the surplus to domestic crushers, but low 1986 U.S. Crop prices have discouraged the purchase of Chinese origin beans for crushing, they said.

S'The start of trading on the new Singapore Government Securities Market has been postponed until late March or early April because legislative amendments still need parliamentary approval, banking sources said.     The new bill market, intended to establish a base for a wider capital market and to encourage private bond issues in Singapore, was supposed to be launched today.     William K.K. Wong, managing director of Indosuez Asia (Singapore) Ltd, said there is no real obstacle to prevent the new market from taking off. Most dealers are optimistic it will provide more liquidity for operators to trade, he said.     Lawrence Yeo, director of Citicorp Investment B"ank (Singapore) Ltd, said the market\'s success depends on domestic "participation.     The five primary dealers and the three registered dealers will all be local companies.     The primary dealers are <Commercial Discount Co Ltd>, <National Discount Co Ltd>, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd <OCBM.SI>, <Overseas Union Bank Ltd> and United Overseas Bank Ltd <UOBM.SI>. They will underwrite the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) auctions, maintain market liquidity and channel open-market operations, MAS said.     <Citicorp Investment Bank (Singapore) Ltd>, <Indosuez Asia (Singapore) Ltd> and <Credit Suisse First Boston Asia Ltd> will be recognised as registered dealers. They will act as market makers but will not bid directly at auctions.     MAS plans to launch trading by issuing taxable instruments grossing seven billion dlrs in the first year and a gross 38 billion dlrs of paper over the first five years.     Non-competitive bids from primary dealers prepared to accept average yield will be allocated first, to a maximum 500,000 dlrs for notes and bonds and to an unlimited amount for treasury bills.     The remaining amount will be awarded to competitive bidders from the lowest yield upwards.     In the secondary market, the standard lot traded between dealers will be one mln dlrs worth of treasury bills and 500,000 dlrs worth of government notes and bonds.  REUTER \\x03'

S'"Sweden\'s Wallenberg group fought back a bid by the London-based Swe"dish financier Erik Penser to secure a large stake in Swedish Match <SMBS ST>, one of the companies at the core of their business empire.     A statement issued by the Wallenberg holding companies AB Investor and Forvaltnings AB Providentia said they had taken over an option held by Nobel Industrier Sweden AB to acquire 33 pct of the voting rights in Swedish Match.     Thre Wallenbergs paid Nobel Industrier <NOBL ST>, in which Penser group has a 72 pct stake, about 20 pct over the market price for the Swedish Match option, the st"atement said.     Swedish Match\'s B shares open to foreign buyers c"losed at 424 crowns on Friday. The A shares -- with increased voting rights -- closed at 450 crowns for the restricted and 455 for th"e free shares.     The statement said the deal increased Investor\'s" stake to 49.4 pct of the voting rights and 14.8 pct of the share capital while Providentia is left holding 34.1 pct of the voting rights and 14.5 pct of the share capital in Swedish Match.     The Wa"llenbergs\' stake in Swedish Match had previously amounted to 52 pct" of the voting rights in the company.     The Swedish Match deal will cost the Wallenbergs about 400 mln crowns, share analysts said, making it one of the most expensise moves the group has undertaken in the last four years to defend its far-flung interests from outside predators.     The Wallenbergs originally sold Nobel Industrier, an arms and chemicals group, to Penser in 1984 to pay for buying Volvo <VOLV ST> out of two other key group companies, Atlas Copco <ASTS ST> and Stora Koppabergs <SKPS ST>.     Since then, the Wallenbergs were ousted as the largest shareholders in SKF (SKFR ST> by Skanska AB <SKBS ST> and Frederik Lundberg wrested control of Incentive AB from them.     Lundberg, a Zurich-based Swedish property tycoon, also managed to acquire a 25 pct stake in another Wallenberg company, the diary equipment firm Alfa -Laval AB <ALFS ST>.     During 1986, the Wallenbergs have been concentrating on building up their stake in Investor and Providentia to prevent any raid on the he"art of their business empire.     But analysts say the Wallenbergs\'" position in the electrical engineering firm ASEA AB <ASEA ST> is also too small at 12.6 pct of the voting rights and there has been growing speculation that the group will be forced to sell off fringe interests to protect its core activities.

S'Soybean imports are forecast to rise to 425,000 tonnes in 1987/88 (October/September) from an estimated 300,000 in 1986/87 and 375,000 in 1985/86, the U.S. Embassy said in its annual report on Indonesi"a\'s agriculture.     It said Indonesia did not achieve its goal of "self-sufficiency in soybean output in calendar 1986 because it did not meet a planned increase in area planted and because yields have remained below target.     Soybean meal imports are forecast to fall to around 190,000 tonnes in 1987/88 from 270,000 tonnes in 1986/87 and 295,000 tonnes in 1985/86.     Domestic soybean production is forecast to rise steadily to 1.08 mln tonnes in 1987/88 from 980,000 in the current year and 890,000 in 1985/86, the report said.     Imports are forecast to fall in the current year but to rise in 1987/88 because of a new soybean crushing plant due to come on stream in early 1988.     China is the main supplier with a 79 pct share, while the U.S. Provides the rest, it said.     "This pattern will likely continue during 1986/87 since domestic soyfood processors prefer Chinese beans and are willing to pay a premium for them," it said.     Area planted is expected to increase by 10 pct in both 1986/87 and 1987/88.     "Yield increases continue to be hampered by an insufficient supply of quality seeds, along with pest and disease problems," the report said.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Japanese banks are expected to give Nigerian debt negotiators a cool response when they arrive here tomorrow for talks, banking sources said.     "We\\\'re not very enthusiastic about Nigeria\\\'s debt rescheduling," said a senior official at a leading Japanese bank.     A team of Nigerian officials will meet with Japanese creditor banks here later this week to seek Japanese support for a proposed ref"inancing of part of Nigeria\'s 19 billion dlr foreign debt, bankers "said.     The senior bank official said a majority of Japanese bank creditors are unwilling to provide any new credits to Nigeria although about 80 pct have reluctantly agreed to accept rescheduling of part of their existing loans.     "The problem is Nigeria has so far neglected us Japanese creditors and we have yet to receive a clear-cut picture of the nation\\\'s debt situation," said another Japanese bank official.     He said Japanese bankers were unaware of the exact extent of Western commercial bank exposure to Nigeria and were uncertain about the proposed refinancing package details.     Some 21 Japanese banks have loans outstanding to Nigeria, representing about four pct of the credit extended by Western commercial institutions, banking sources said.     They said Nigeria would probably request about 320 mln dlrs in fresh private bank money and rescheduling of some 1.4 to 1.5 billion dlrs in existing loans due in 1986 and 1987. Japanese banks want Nigeria to make clear its debt repayment scheme as well as its economic reconstruction plans during the two-day meeting here, the sources added.     "Otherwise, our response will be very negative," the senior official said.     Banking sources said some 80 pct of international creditor banks involved have responded positively to the Nigerian debt proposal.     Bank of Japan officials said they hope Japanese commercial banks will help Nigeria overcome its debt problems.     Barclays Bank plc <BCS".L> has the most exposure to Nigeria\'s debt and is chairing a bank "steering committee looking at the problem, the banking sources said. BankAmerica Corp <BAC.N> is coordinating private bank creditors in the Far East and representing them on the committee, they added.  REUTER \\x03'

S'The Bank of England said it forecast a shortage of around 800 mln stg in the money market today.     Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain some 1.61 billion stg.     Partly offsetting this outflow, exchequer transactions and a fall in note circulation will add around 425 mln stg and 360 mln stg respectively. In addi"tion, bankers\' balances above target will add some 20 mln stg to th"e system today.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone is likely to leave office this summer amid opposition to his controversial tax-reform package, politi"cal analysts said.     They said Nakasone\'s reputation as a skilled" politician has suffered irreparable damage from his support of a five pct sales tax planned for January 1988.     "Nakasone is trying to carry out a drastic tax reform at the end of his administration, which is not only impossible but also is very irresponsible as a politican," Rei Shiratori, professor of politics at Dokkyo University, told Reuters.     "Nakasone will almost certainly step down as soon as parliament approves the sales tax, probably in the summer," Shiratori said.     Some ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) members of parliament have spoken against the tax, which Nakasone says is needed to balance planned cuts in income and corporate taxes.     Nakasone today called for disciplinary action against LDP members who oppose the tax. "There are some who are objecting because of their constituencies," he told a meeting of government and party leaders. "If the party discipline is broken, I would like to see punishment considered."     "A proposed sales tax has become a political issue, partly because Nakasone breached his election pledge against introducing it," Shiratori said.     "Moreover, the tax is being introduced when the public feels uncertainty about the sluggis"h economy stemming from the yen\'s appreciation and about the future" when the Japanese society is rapidly aging," he said.     Political analysts said the controversial tax could affect the more than 2,500 local elections scheduled for April, involving governors, mayors, town and village heads and assemblies at all levels.     But the situation is complicated, since opposition parties excluding the communists sometimes put up joint candidates with the LDP, the political analysts added.     Shiratori said, "In the worst case, implementation of the sales tax, now scheduled for next January, may be put off for some time before the government makes a final decision.     "Another alternative is to modify the planned five pct to perhaps three pct.     "A third alternative for the government is to ram through the bills only with the attendance of LDP MPs," he said.     Seizaburo Sato, professor of politics at Tokyo University, thought the last possibility most likely. "I think the LDP alone will take a vote on the tax bills," he said.     The LDP now holds 304 seats in the 512-seat Lower House and 143 in the 252-seat Upper House.     To lure opposition parties back to parliament after the LDP pushes through the tax bills, the Nakasone cabinet will have to resign, Sato said.     "Boycotting opposition members will be more willing to return to parliament if a new cabinet has been formed," he said.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Thousands of black mineworkers roared support for a union proposal "to seize control of South Africa\'s gold, uranium, platinum and coal" mines if the owners refuse to improve conditions for migrant black workers.     About 15,000 miners attended a rally here to endorse" moves proposed by last week\'s annual meeting of the 200,000 strong" National Union of Mineworkers (NUM).     They also supported a proposal for a national strike at the end of this month if the owners refused to begin negotiations.     Migrant workers from surrounding countries make up more than half of the labour force in the mines.     It was not stated how the union would "seize control."     T"he miners\' leaders also demanded an end to the system of single sex" hostels for migrant workers, to be replaced by housing schemes so that workers could live with their families.     The crowd, one of the largest to attend a meeting since South Africa declared a state of emergency last June, also shouted approval of a proposal to work closely with anti-apartheid movements such as the United Democratic Front (UDF) which claims two mln members. They also shouted their support for a demand that jailed black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela be released.  REUTER \\x03'

The ministry said the fresh allocation, for the February 27-July 7 shipment period, is the third under a maximum 5.5 mln tonne overall quota that Thailand obtained from the EC for calendar 1987.     It said the quota allocation was based on a national tapioca pellet stock of 4.34 mln tonnes surveyed last week, up from 3.05 mln in mid-January.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Mine and industry officials from most member states of the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) say they have found ways to limit group exports to 96,000 tonnes in the year started March 1, according to views polled by Reuter correspondents.     The plan to curb exports, agreed in January, is aimed at cutting the world surplus to 50,000 tonnes from 70,000 now and boosting prices to about 19 ringgit a kilo from just over 16.     Members of the seven-member" Kuala Lumpur-based ATPC account for some 65 pct of the world\'s tin" output.     Under the ATPC plan, Malaysia has been allocated an export quota of 28,526 tonnes, Indonesia 24,516, Thailand 19,000, Bolivia 13,761, Zaire 1,736 and Nigeria 1,461.     Australia has said it is not setting any export quota. However, the tonnage allocated to it, 7,000 tonnes, is roughly equal to its expected output this year.     Comment from officials in Zaire was unavailable.     Min"e officials in Malaysia, the world\'s leading producer, said only 18"8 mines will be allowed to operate to ensure that output is limited to around 31,500 tonnes in the year started March 1.     Chief Inspector of Mines Redzuan Sumun told Reuters that excess output of some 3,000 tonnes after exports of 28,500 in the one-year quota period would be kept in the national stock.     Mine owners in Malaysia have welcomed the ATPC export curb and asked the government not to issue new mining licences. More than 100 applications for licences are pending.     Redzuan said the Mines Department would approve new mining licences only if a six-month review of production trends showed that local mines were not overproducing.     ATPC chairman "and Indonesia\'s Mining and Energy Minister Subroto has pledged his ""country\'s support for the export curb.     A spokesman for the stat"e-owned tin mining company PT Tambang Timah told Reuters it would be easy for Indonesia to stick to an export quota of 24,516 tonnes because this was close to exports in calendar 1986 of 24,636.     In Bangkok, Thai Industry Minister Pramual Sabhavasu said Thailand would keep to its 19,000 tonne quota and added this would not cause the local industry hardship at current prices.     To insure adherence, the industry ministry and sole tin exporter Thailand Smelting and Refining Co would encourage bigger stockpiles, and income tax exemptions would be permitted, he said.     The Thai Mineral Resources Department is expected to disallow new tin mines opening this year to prevent excessive production, industry sources said.     But Mining Industry Council President Dam Teutong told Reuters that if the tin price rose above 18 ringgit a kilo, Thai miners would press for the opening of more new mines.     Thailand exported 18,367 tonnes in 1986, up from 17,359 in 1985, Pramual said.     Bolivia said it expects to export less tin this year than its allocated 13,761 tonne quota.     Mining Minister Jaimie Villalobos told Reuters in La Paz that Bolivia expected to export about 9,000 tonnes of tin in calendar 1987.     He said this was due to the sacking after the tin crisis of October 1985 of about 20,000 of the 28,000 workers at the state mining company Comibol, which produces more than 80 "pct of Bolivia\'s total exports.     He said there were risks in th"e ATPC plan to cut exports but added he was confident the goals set by the plan would be achieved. He did not elaborate.     Mines, Power and Steel Minister Bunu Sheriff Musa said in Lagos that Nigeria would have no difficulty keeping within its ATPC quota of 1,461 tonnes because its metals output had declined due to poor demand and high production costs.     Industry sources told Reuters that Nige"ria\'s output was less than 1,000 tonnes last year.     ATPC offici""als said they would monitor member countries\' export figures every "three months using customs documents and make projections from such data to see if quotas were likely to be breached within the year-long quota period.     The ATPC officials said members that appeared likely to breach their quotas would be told to take remedial measures.     They added that if member countries were unable to fulfil their quotas their extra tonnage would be reallocated to other memb"ers at the ATPC\'s discretion.     The ATPC would have produced and "exported an estimated 106,000 tonnes of tin in 1987 without the plan.     Non-members Brazil and China have pledged to cooperate with the ATPC and limit their exports to 21,000 and 7,000 tonnes respectively during the quota period.  REUTER \\x03'

S'South Korea plans to take steps to keep its 1987 current account surplus below five billion dlrs, Economic Planning Board Minister Kim Mahn-je said.     Kim told reporters the government would repay loans ahead of schedule and encourage firms to increase imports and investment abroad to prevent the current account surplus from risin"g too quickly.     Last year South Korea\'s current account surplus "was 4.65 billion dlrs. It widened to 622 mln dlrs in January from 484 mln in December and compared with a deficit of 334 mln in January 1986, Bank of Korea figures show.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Gold output in the northeast China province of Heilongjiang rose 22".7 pct in 1986 from 1985\'s level, the New China News Agency said. I""t gave no figures.     It said the province, China\'s second largest" gold producer after Shandong, plans to double gold output by 1990 from the 1986 level. China does not publish gold production figures.     However, industry sources estimate output at about 65 tonnes a year, with exports put between 11 and 31 tonnes.     China is selling more gold abroad to offset large trade deficits in recent years, western diplomats said.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Disagreement over management of <San Miguel Corp> (SMC) may follow "the Philippine government\'s appointment of a well-known banker to t"he SMC board, investment analysts said.     They told Reuters the presence of <United Coconut Planters Bank> (UCPB) president Ramon Sy to the board of SMC may mean changes in SMC management, which for decades was controlled by the family of its president, Andres Soriano.     Sy was appointed by a government commission that controls "51 pct of San Miguel\'s stock, after another nominee resigned.     T"he Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) holds six seats on the 15-member SMC board, which represent 33.13 mln sequestered shares.     The stocks were seized on suspicion that they were owned by Eduardo Cojuangco, then chairman of UCPB and San Miguel. He was a close associate of deposed president Ferdinand Marcos, and he "left the country after Marcos\'s fall.     Before the seizure, Soria"no led a 3.3 billion peso bid for the shares, paying UCPB a 500 mln peso deposit.     The bid valued the shares at about 100 pesos. Th"ey traded at 93 pesos today, down from 95.50 at Friday\'s close.   "  Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin told reporters on Saturday that Sy would definitely sit on the SMC board despite the objections of some directors associated with Soriano.     "I don\\\'t think there is a conflict of interest as such," he said.     "I was potentially concerned with seeing a situation where you have a contentious atmosphere on the board. But Sy has assured (the government) that he does not intend to behave in a contentious manner," Ongpin added.    " The Soriano group cited conflict of interest in opposing Sy\'s dire"ctorship. Its lawyer said in a letter to the PCGG that a pending su"it seeking forfeiture of SMC\'s 500 mln peso deposit and major undis"closed damages against the brewery represented a clear conflict.  "   UCPB, however, sought board representation before Sy\'s appointme"nt, petitioning the PCGG "so that the interests of the owners of the 33 mln shares would be adequately protected."     Investment analysts polled by Reuters said the UCPB had a right to a slot on the SMC board as trustee for coconut farmers who claim ownership of the disputed shares.     The analysts said Sy, backed by the government, would probably suggest replacements for PCGG nominees expected to resign soon in keeping with a new law prohibiting government offi"cials from working for private companies. SMC\'s annual election is "scheduled for May.     A UCPB spokesman declined to comment, saying it was up to the PCGG to decide whom to appoint.     One analyst said objections were understandable from the family that founded the company 97 years ago.     "It is a natural instinct of self-preservation for Soriano," he said.     SMC posted a net income of 448.8 mln pesos in 1985 on net sales of 10.99 billion pesos against 422.3 mln in 1984 on sales of 10.36 billion.  REUTER \\x03'

S'"The combined profits of Japan\'s major corporations, excluding finan"cial institutions, are forecast to fall 19.2 pct in the 1986/87 year ending March 31, compared to the 19.9 pct decline projected in late November, Wako Research Institute of Economics said.     The private research body also said in a statement that 437 of the 1,084 firms listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange foresee an 11.6 pct fall in sales in the year against an 11.4 pct fall estimated last November.     Current profits are projected to fall 4.4 pct in 1987/88 on sales seen increasing by 4.2 pct, it said.     Rationalisation measures taken by manufacturing industries to cop"e with the yen\'s sharp rise are beginning to brighten their busines"s outlook, the institute said.     It said lower interest rates, which are expected to reduce corporate borrowing costs, are also behind the improved performance outlook.     Earnings performance in the non-manufacturing sector will be supported by firm demand in the real estate and construction businesses, it said.     The forecast was based on average exchange rate estimates of 160 yen to the dollar in 1986/87 and 155 yen in 1987/88.  REUTER \\x03'

S'"Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi\'s fiscal 1987/88 budget has sparked spe""culation that a large deficit will push up India\'s moderate inflati""on rate and that the country\'s stock markets will experience prolon"ged uncertainty, economists, politicians and stockbrokers told Reuters.     The projected deficit for fiscal 1987/88, ending March, is 56.88 billion rupees, down from an upwardly revised estimate of a record 82.85 billion in fiscal 1986/87.     The projected inflation rate for fiscal 1986/87, based on wholesale prices, is 6.5 pct against 3.8 pct in 1985/86.     Economists pointed out that the government itself had expressed concern about inflation in its most recent 1986/87 economic survey report published last week.     Presenting the budget to parliament on Saturday, Prime Minister Gandhi said a cabinet committee would be appointed to trim large non-development expenditures. The deficit for 1987/88 will not be allowed to exceed the budgeted figure, he said.     But few analysts have taken" Gandhi\'s assurance seriously. They say the deficit more than doubl"ed in 1986/87 from an initial estimate of 36.5 billion rupees.     Lal Krishna Advani, president of the opposition Bharatiya Janata p"arty, said Gandhi\'s failure to mention specific measures to cut non"-development expenses will push up prices.     Economists said increased liquidity in the economy, as reflected by expansion of the M3 aggregate money supply, may cause prices to rise. The survey report showed the M3 rose by 15.7 pct or 185.78 billion rupees in the first nine months of 1986/87 against 13.37 pct or 136.42 billion in the same 1985/86 period.     Economists also said uncertain monsoon rain prospects, after bad weather last year, may strain prices further.     Economists said the deficit would also cause the government to rely increasingly on internal borrowing. Market loans and bonds were projected at 981.50 billion rupees for 1987/88, up from the 1986/87 estimate of 852.13 billion.     No reduction has been proposed in personal income taxes, which will discourage savings, economists said.     Avinash Purulkar, chief manager of the state-owned Union Bank of India, said the annual inflation rate may double to around 15 pct in 1987/88 as the government prints more currency notes to cover the deficit.     Brokers said stock market investors have started selling long-term portfolios to take advantage of a proposal in the budget that reduces the holding period required to claim exemption from the capital gains tax to one year from three.     Delhi stockbroker B. D. Aggarwal said, "There is uncertainty in the market. There is going to be growing selling pressure."     But Bombay broker Dinesh Walji said the present hectic selling of shares will slow when more buyers appear on the scene. "Just now there is acute nervousness in the market," he said.     Brokers said proposals to set up a mutual fund to help small investors buy equity shares and relaxations in the capital gains tax will inject further buoyancy into the market on a long-term basis.     New equity and debenture issues, both convertible and non-convertible, rose to an officially estimated 50.70 billion rupees in April/January 1986/87 from an estimated 36.95 billion in all 1985/86 and 20 billion in all 1984/85.

S'The Bank of Japan decided at a policy board meeting to promote further interest rate liberalisation by lowering the minimum denomination of regulation-free large deposits and by raising the interest rate ceiling on money market certificates (MMCs), a central bank official said.     The new guideline will go into effect on April 6, the bank said.     Under the guideline, the minimum denomination of regulation-free large deposits will be lowered to 100 mln yen from 300 mln.     The interest rate ceiling of MMCs with maturities of between one year and two years will be set at 0.5 percentage point below the prevailing certificate of deposit rate, the bank said.     But the ceiling on MMCs with maturities of one year or less will remain the same, or 0.75 percentage point below the CD rates.     The minimum denomination of MMCs will be lowered to 10 mln yen from 30 mln.     The bank also said time deposit rates will be lowered by 0.37 point, effective March 16, in line with the half-point cut in the official discount rate on February 23.     New interest rates on two-year and one-year deposits at banks, for example, will be 3.64 pct and 3.39 pct per annum, respectively.     Demand deposit rates, however, will remain the same.

S'The Bank of England said the broad measure of U.K. Money supply, Sterling M3, rose a seasonally adjusted 1.1 pct in January after a 0.2 pct rise in December.     The unadjusted year-on-year rise was 17.6 pct after 18.1 pct in the year to December.     The narrow measure of money supply, M0, fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.6 pct in January, and rose by a non-adjusted 4.1 pct year-on-year, the Bank said.     The figures confirm provisional data issued by the Bank two weks ago.     In December, M0 grew by a seasonally adjusted 1.4 pct and by a non-seasonally adjusted 5.2 pct year-on-year.     The Bank said sterling bank lending grew by a non-seasonally adjusted 1.75 billion stg in January. This also confirmed provisional figures issued in February.     The measure of private sector liquidity, PSL2, fell 0.2 pct in January, but after seasonal adjustment rose 0.6 pct, the Bank said.     The Bank said the public sector contribution to the growth in Sterling M3 was contractionary by about 2.3 billion stg.     Within this, the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) showed a repayment of 3.7 billion stg, while the non-bank" private sector\'s holdings of government debt fell by about 1.1 bi"llion stg.     There was a fall of 290 mln stg in notes and coin in January, a fall of 1.5 billion stg in non-interest bearing sight deposits, and a rise of 1.6 billion stg in interest bearing sight deposits, the Bank said.

S'<Exco International Plc>, a subsidiary of British and Commonwealth Shipping Co Plc <BCOM.L>, said it had agreed in principle to buy an 80 pct stake in <RMJ Holdings Corp> for about 79 mln dlrs.     Exco Chairman Richard Lacy told Reuters the acquisition was being made from Bank of New York Co Inc <BK.N>, which currently holds a 50.1 pct, and from RMJ partners who hold the remainder.     Bank of New York and the partners will retain about 10 pct each and these stakes will be bought over the next six years.     RMJ is the holding company of RMJ Securities, one of the largest U.S. Government securities brokers.     It is also involved in broking notes, obligations and other instruments sponsored by U.S. Federal agencies.     Lacy said Exco had been considering buying a U.S. Government securities broker for the past four years and had made an offer for RMJ when it was sold by Security Pacific Corp <SPC.N> in 1985. RMJ was then valued at about 50 mln dlrs.     B and C managing director Peter Goldie said RMJ would be bought at about the same multiple as Exco, "suggesting net income of around 16 mln dlrs.     The company\'s ear"nings had not been hit by the halving of brokerage fees some 14 months ago as volumes had since doubled.     Lacy said that RMJ employed some 300 people, with 200 in the brokerage business and about 70 in its <SMS> unit, which provided computer software for the financial services community.     RMJ Securities had offices in New York, where total market turnover of U.S. Government securities was 110 billion dlrs a day, and in London where it has 15 billion.     It was also given permission last week to open an office in Tokyo where total market turnover had lifted rapidly to about five billion dlrs a day.     The acquisition would contribute between five and 10" pct of B and C\'s share earnings in 1987 on a proforma basis.  REU"TER \\x03'

S'Hungary is to embark on a new series of austerity measures to tackle a budget deficit which tripled last year after quadrupling in 1985.     The target deficit in the 1987 budget approved by Parliament last December was 43.8 billion forints.     But Zoltan Boesze, ch"ief of the Finance Ministry\'s budget financing division, told Reute"rs the government now saw this as too high and had decided "quite severe" measures were needed.     "All the organizations of economic management have been charged with elaborating further (savings) measures," he said.     Asked if these measures were being taken under pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Boesze said: "The Fund suggested it would be good to improve monetary results, and of course the Fund would support these efforts."     IMF teams spent several weeks in Budapest late last year.     Boesze said pre"liminary figures showed that Hungary\'s state budget deficit rose to" a preliminary 47 billion forints last year from 15.8 billion in 1985 and 3.7 billion in 1984.     The economy overshot a target deficit of 23 billion forints because of poor performance by state firms, which needed subsidies and tax incentives to export and earn hard currency.     The exact extent and nature of savings are still under discussion but subsidies to state enterprises -- the largest budget item -- must definitely fall, Boesze said.     Subsidies to state firms, including grants to maintain low consumer prices, exceeded the plan by nine billion to reach 164 billion forints in 1986, up from 152.9 billion in 1985. Parliament approved 1987 subsidies of 170 billion forints.     "I think that in 1987 it is quite impossible to keep up the former situation and we will be obliged to reduce subsidies," Boesze said. "The central administration must be hard. ... If we are not hard then we will not be successful."     Boesze said the budget could also make savings from reserve provisions of two billion forints for central expenditure and 800 mln forints for transfers to local authorities. "I believe these reserves should not be used at all," he said.     Wage growth last year outstripped that of gross domestic product, which expanded one pct instead of a planned 2.5 pct.     The authorities had already signalled a small fall in real wages for 1987, but Boesze said firms will suffer severe tax penalties if they award nominal rises of over one or two pct.     This would mean a severe cut in living standards, as retail price inflation is forecast at seven pct after 5.3 pct in 1986.     A four-month basic wage freeze expires on April 1.     About 40 pct of the 1986 subsidies to state enterprises and 33 pct in 1985 were made to maintain low consumer prices.     Boesze said pure economic policy would dictate significant cuts in price subsidies, but that social considerations made this difficult.     But he added: "I think ultimately we will be able to make curtailments in subsidies in this area as well."     He said Hungary plans to introduce price reform at the beginning of 1988 at the same time as personal taxation and value added tax. The IMF supports these aims.     Hungary introduced a bankrupcty law last September in an attempt to shake out surplus labour from inefficient firms.     Between 100,000 and 150,000 workers are expected to be unemployed at least temporarily by 1990. Labour discipline is being tightened and firms may fire workers more easily.     Boesze said the per capita employment tax paid to the state by firms was being raised this year to encourage enterprises to shed labour. He gave no exact figures.     Istvan Nagy, a senior Finance Ministry official responsible for drafting the bankrupcy law, told Reuters last year he hoped the law would cut state subsidies to enterprises by 50 pct.     After subsidies to state enterprises, the largest single budget items are social insurance (153 billion forints approved for 1987) and transfers to local councils (80 billion).     Interest payments on international debt are set to rise to more than 10 billion forints in 1987 from betwee"n six and seven billion in 1986, Boesze said.     Hungary\'s net ha"rd currency debt leapt by 54 pct last year to 7.7 billion dlrs, according to provisional figures, while trade with Western countries plunged into a deficit of more than 400 mln dlrs from a 1.2 billion "dlr surplus just two years earlier.     Boesze said last year\'s bu"dget deficit was financed 90 pct by credits from the National Bank, mostly from abroad, and 10 pct by the issue of domestic state bonds.     Deputy Prime Minister Frigyes Berecz told Hungarian economists in a speech this month that the country\\\'s economy was in a "very difficult" situation, but not in crisis.     There would have to be a turnround with tangible results this year, however, and borrowing must be used more effectively.     "Any rise in our present loans may prove to be dangerous," Berecz said.

S'Alaska Housing Finance Corp, a local U.S. Government agency, has become the first municipal entity to tap the syndicated loan market, receiving a 150 mln dlr, seven-year revolving loan, said Merrill Lynch Capital Markets as arranger.     Merrill said the loan is a back-up to a proposed euro-commercial paper program.     The syndicated loan, which is unsecured, carries a commitment fee of 0.10 pct per year. Advances will be priced at 31-1/4 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate while notes, which need only be purchased by banks if third party investors agree to buy them as well, will be priced at offering.     Alaska Housing Finance was established by the legislature of the state of Alaska in 1971, and has so far acquired 6.1 billion dlrs of mortgages originated in Alaska.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Japanese consumers hesitated about buying the controversial digital audio tape player (DAT) as it went on sale in Tokyo today, but sai"d the DAT player\'s near-perfect sound will make it a success once i"t becomes cheaper.     "The sound is great, but I\\\'ll wait until more machines hit the market and prices fall to about 100,000 yen before buying one," said Terumi Fujitsuka, 35, a steel firm employee.     Aiwa, Sharp and Matsushita displayed their DAT players today al"though delivery will take about two weeks, retailers said. Aiwa\'s m"achine, the cheapest, is listed at 188,000 yen.     Machines by Sony, Hitachi, Toshiba and others will appear as early as the end of March, industry sources said.     DAT players can play back and record with fidelity superior to even a compact disc. They use a cassette half the size of the standard audio cassette and unlike conventional analogue machines, they can make copies an infinite number of times with almost no loss of sound quality.     This aroused fears in the music industry of widespread tape piracy and loss of royalt"ies. In negotiations that delayed the DAT player\'s debut, the indus"try demanded anti-piracy circuitry be built into the machines.     Machines sold in Japan are fitted with a computer chip to prevent copying through a digital signal. But copies can still be made if the signal is routed through a regular amplifier. "Nobody can tell the difference," one salesman said.     DAT players have been kept off Western markets and some countries are considering banning them or imposing heavy duties unless tougher anti-piracy circuitry is added. But Japanese hardware makers, hard pressed for profits in the era of the high yen and growing competition, are eager to carve out a profitable niche.     Prices of DAT players will probably fall quickly, possibly to around 70,000 yen by next year as other makers put their products on the market, industry analysts said.     They said by 1990, sales could reach six mln units per year.     Philips of the Netherlands has said it will launch its DAT player on the world market later this year.  REUTER \\x03'

S'"Italy\'s strong economic revival has led some observers to talk of m"iracles and created euphoria in some quarters about future growth prospects, but many Italian experts warn that the current wave of optimism is excessive.     "I think all this foreign interest in the so-called Italian miracle is really exaggerated...Foreign observers always oscillate in the case of Italy between complete pessimism and unwarranted optimism," says Luigi Spaventa, one of Italy\\\'s leading economists and a professor at Rome University.     According to Spaventa, these violent swings of mood have been occurring for the last 15 years, with Italy one minute seen as the "bad boy of Europe" and unable to raise a dollar and the next a worker of miracles and basking in admiration,     "I think there\\\'s a lot of exaggeration...Once it used to be the underground economy and all the correspondents of foreign newspapers flocked to Italy to study this. That was another story about nothing - like writing about a black cat in a dark room."     Spaventa, in tune with other economists and in"dustrialists here, stress Italy\'s recent achievements, particularly" the dramatic and solid recovery in the fortunes of industrial enterprises, but warns that the economy is still vulnerable.      Profits of private sector firms such as Fiat S.P.A., <FIAT.M> and <ING. C. Olivetti and C. S.P.A.> are booming, the major state industries are back in the black after years of losses, inflation has nosedived and the trade and balance of payments deficits have been slashed. Expectations by some experts that Italy is poised to replace Brit"ain as the world\'s fifth largest economy have also boosted optimism".     Italy itself has made it clear it is not happy with what it feels to be its second-rate status among the major industrialised countries.     Only this week, it angrily demanded clarification of this status after being excluded from a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Five (G-5) - comprising the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain.     Italy said its exclusion from the meeting violated an agreement reached in Tokyo last year to let Italy and Canada attend meetings held by the five whenever discussions concerned managing the international monetary system.     But Italy needs first to tackle some fundamental problems still facing its economy, economists and industrialists say.     "We must not forget that ours is still a vulnerable economy," warns Fiat man"aging director Cesare Romiti.     He says that while Italy\'s recent" achievements are indeed cause for satisfaction and optimism, the focus now should be on the problems still remaining rather than thos"e already solved.     The country\'s huge state sector deficit, high" unemployment and a heavy dependence on imported oil are among the most worrying problems, experts say.     The size of the state spending deficit -- estimated at 109,561 billion lire in 1986 and targetted at 100,000 billion lire this year -- means there is a risk inflation could spiral again, says Carlo Scognamiglio, head of the private Luiss university in Rome.     Inflation fell into single digits for the first time in a decade in September 1984 and by January this year was running at 4.5 pct, but it is still not low enough to guarantee international competiveness, economists and industrialists say.     And unemployment was running at 11.6 pct nationally last October according to the latest official data.     Recent official data showed that of a total 2.77 million people seeking work in October 1986, almost 73 pct were aged between 14 and 29. Unemployment in the south was running at 17.7 pct, more than double that in the industrial north.     The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) recently forecast that Italian gross domestic product (GDP) would rise rise three pct in 1987 after expanding 2.5 pct in 1986. But it warned that growth was unlikely to be enoug"h to check rising unemployment.     Another problem is Italy\'s rel"iance on imported raw materials. The country imports around 80 pct of its fuel needs.     This factor actually worked sharply in Italy"\'s favour last year, when lower energy costs helped slash the count""ry\'s trade deficit to 3,717 billion lire  by year end from 23,085 b"illion lire in 1985.     But economists say the improvement owes little to any structural change in the Italian economy and that any reversal of the trend in costs could have serious consequences.   "  If Italy truly wants to be counted among the world\'s top industri"alised nations, it also needs to tighten up stockmarket operating procedures and encourage firms to supply more quality information about their activities, economists say.     Italy has no controls on insider trading.     The country also needs to shed its rigid capital movements controls -- a European Community directive calls for these to be dismantled by 1992 -- but this too will require a less blinkered attitude and a change in traditional operating procedures, economists say.     "Even today, if I wanted to invest in the Tok"yo bourse, I doubt I\'d find the expertise in a brokerage firm or in" banks which would allow me to do that," says Spaventa.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Japan and the U.S. Kick off top-level trade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are growing increasingly irritated with each other.     The talks, held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the whole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations, will pave "the way for American Secretary of State George Schultz\'s one day s"top-over here at end-week on his way home from China.     Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure, the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action to reduce its still huge trade surplus, U.S. Officials said.     "We appreciate their frustration," a senior Japanese government official said. "But we are also frustrated."     The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last 18 months has hit Japan hard, forcing exporters to slash spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad. That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade, but it will, he said.     He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progress that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that remain when it talks with Congress.     "It would only take five minutes to list their accomplishments," a senior U.S. Official replied.     The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the economic structures of both countries and how they affect the bilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48 billio"n dlrs in Japan\'s favour.     On the following two days, the topics" will range from multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral trade problems as super computers.     The structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling discussions among senior officials. Tomorr"ow\'s topics include savings and investment issues such as consumer "credit and housing, and the implications of government budget deficits.     These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the Japanese government, which is facing increasing domestic pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and stimulate the sagging economy by spending more.     Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention of boosting domestic demand and imports, as Washington wants.     Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge U.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade imbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Is buying more imports.     Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial trade practices. "It condemns Japan without due process," one Japanese official said.     That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out bill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, he said.     Japan is also not totally happy with the adm"inistration\'s trade bill, particularly its proposal to establish re"ciprocal access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade action by the U.S., Officials said.     Nevertheless, Japanese officials said they remain in a weak bargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade bill overhanging them.     "We have no leverage," one official admitted.     As a result, Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaints about its trade practices in a variety of fields, including super computers.     The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese super computer market.     The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to public institutions like universities which buy the sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential sellers, officials said.

S'<Qantas Airways Ltd> has placed a firm order with Boeing Co <BA> for four 747-400 aircraft at a cost of 250 mln Australian dlrs each, chairman Jim Leslie said.     The first is due for delivery in April 1989 with the others arriving in May, June and September of that year, he said in a statement.     The 400 series is the latest model of the Boeing 747 family, he said.     The purchase will take g"overnment-owned Qantas\'s 747 fleet to 28, he said.     Leslie said" Qantas is talking to three engine makers who are all offering engines for the Boeing 747-400 and it will announce a decision on engine purchases later this year.     He said they are <Pratt and Whitney> and General Electric Co <GE>, a unit of United Technologies Corp" <UTX>, and Britain\'s <Rolls-Royce Ltd>.     He said the 747-400, "which incorporates new technology such as extended wings with six-feet high winglets and enhanced electronics, should have its first flight next February. The 400 series has a designed range of 12,500 "kms, 2,140 kms further than the current Qantas 747-300\'s, he said. "    The aircraft will be financed by foreign borrowings and foreign exchange earnings, and Qantas believes they will pay for themselves in four to five years, Leslie said.     The 747-400 has a take-off weight of 870,000 pounds, up from 833,000 for the 300 series, and offers an eight pct fuel saving, he said.     The higher range and payload means they will first be used on the route to Britain and Europe via Asia.     They will also be used on non-stop flights between Sydney and Los Angeles.  REUTER \\x03'

S'The European Community Commission said it has opened an enquiry into allegations that the Soviet Union is dumping mercury on the European market at below-cost prices.     The Commission said its decision follows a complaint from EC non-ferrous metals producers that the sales of Soviet mercury were harming their business and threatening jobs in the European industry.     According to the complaint, Soviet mercury sales in the EC had risen from zero in recent years to 100 tonnes between August and October last year and threaten to capture 25 pct of the EC market if they continue at the same pace.     The industry said the mercury was being sold at more than 40 pct below prices charged by EC producers, forcing them to cut their prices to levels that no longer covered costs. The imports had caused producers heavy financial losses, it said.     The Commission said the industry would probably be unable to hold prices at current levels and that any increase would result in loss of sales and jobs.     The so-called anti-dumping procedure opened by the Commission will allow all interested parties to state their cases to the authority.  REUTER \\x03'

S'The Philippines will offer commercial bank creditors an innovative pricing plan that will make debt payments through certificates of indebtedness instead of cash, the authoritative Business Day newspaper said.     Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin told reporters Saturday that the alternative proposal is designed to avoid an impasse when debt rescheduling talks reopen in New York on Tuesday.     He did not give details but said, "It is a very useful alternative and in the end will permit the banks to say that they achieved their pricing target and will likewise permit the Philippines to say exactly the same thing."     Quoting negotiation documents to be presented "to the country\'s 12-bank advisory committee, Business Day said the "debt certificates will carry maturities of five or six years.     It said the certificates will be classified as zero-coupon bonds or promissory notes with no interest but priced at a considerable discount from their redemption price.     It said the debt bonds will entitle holder banks to a guaranteed return on both interest and principal since no payment of any kind is made until the bond matures.     It said a bank can sell the bonds on the secondary bond market for either dlrs or pesos depending on its requirement.     The peso proceeds can be invested in selected industries under the Philip"pines\' debt/equity program. Ongpin said Manila is sticking to its d"emand of a spread of 5/8 percentage points over London interbank offered Rates (LIBOR) for restructuring 3.6 billion dlrs of debt repayments.     "(The proposal) will give the banks a choice of 5/8ths or the alternative," Ongpin said. "Our representatives have gone to Washington to the (International Monetary) Fund, the (World) Bank, the Fed (Federal Reserve Board) and the (U.S.) Treasury to brief them in advance on this alternative and it has generally been positively received."     "We don\\\'t believe that there is going to be a problem on the accounting side," Ongpin said. "We have run this alternative proposal to the accounting firms. Neither have the government regulators indicated that there will be a problem."  Reuter \\x03'

S'"Argentina\'s chief debt negotiator said he was confident of a prompt" accord with international creditor banks for rescheduling the country\\\'s foreign debt.     "I\\\'m quite optimistic about carrying out a serious and quick negotiation," Treasury Secretary Mario Brodersohn said on return from talks in New York with leading U.S. and world financial officials.     Argentina is currently negotiating terms with the steering committee for its creditor banks that will allow it to meet four pct economic growth targets in 1987. It has also asked for a reduction in interest rates and fresh credit.     Brodersohn said the growth targets were not negotiable, but Argentina did not want to follow Brazil in suspending payments on its foreign debt.     He said Argentina was seeking 2.15 billion dlrs credit to" meet the targets, adding that the banks\' attitude had improved fo""llowing Brazil\'s decision.     The United States and a group of oth"er industrial nations on Thursday granted Argentina a 500 mln dlr bridge loan.     Brodersohn held talks in New York with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker, Federal Reserve chief Paul Volcker and International Monetary Fund (IMF) head Michel Camdessus.  Reuter \\x03'

S'A rift has occured among Philippine officials over debt talks opening tomorrow in New York with Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod accusing the chief negotiator of softening his stand to gain a quick agreement.     Monsod told Reuters Finance Secretary Jaime On"gpin had decided not to insist on Manila\'s creditor banks pledging "to fund half of a projected 1988/92 financing gap of seven billion dlrs.     "He (Ongpin) wants to finish the negotiations as fast as possible. I\\\'m saying that\\\'s very short-sighted," Monsod said.     Monsod said any pricing agreement on rescheduling 3.6 billion dlrs" of the Philippines\' total foreign debt of 27.8 billion dlrs would "ignore a looming 14 billion dlr net resource transfer in the same period.     Manila is seeking a spread of 5/8 percentage points over the London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR).     Monsod said,  "Ri"ght now we are saying to the banks, let\'s share the financing burde"n."     Ongpin said last month the country\\\'s consultative group of multilateral and bilateral aid donors had endorsed a growth facility to bridge the funding gap.      He said the government and the consultative group would meet annually to gauge financing needs for each year. The aid donors and commercial bank creditors would then be asked to finance any gap on a shared basis.     He told reporters on Saturday it would be unwise to try to pin the banks down on "Monsod\'s proposed growth facility.     Ongpin acknowledged there wa"s a dispute over tactics. "Secretary Monsod and I get along famously," he said. "She talks and I listen but I don\\\'t necessarily agree."     Monsod said a firm commitment from the banks on bridging th"e financing gap would have aided the government\'s pump-priming prog"ram and 1987/92 medium-term development plan.     She said if private sector investment continued to be held back by the fear of a balance of payments crisis and rising interest rates, the country would fail to achieve its gross national product (GNP) growth target of an average 6.5 pct over the next six years.     "If you don\\\'t get those seven billion dlrs there is no plan. How can there be a program if there is no finance?" she said, adding Ongpin\\\'s stand was not good for the economy.     "It (Ongpin\\\'s stand) is going to make it much more difficult for the economy to attain its growth targets," Monsod said.     "Considering what the Philippine negotiating team is going to press for there is absolutely no reason why they should not be able to come back (from New York) in a day," she said."     Monsod, the government\'s chief economic planner, stressed Man""ila\'s policy was growth before debt.     She said if the banks refu""sed to lend the new money, the Philippines should copy Brazil\'s act"ion last week in freezing all debt repayments.     "If the banks do not cooperate by lending you back some of the money that you are sending abroad, then of course you have an option," Monsod said. "You just don\\\'t send it abroad. You do a Brazil."  REUTER \\x03'

S'Taiwan plans another round of deep tariff cuts this year to help narrow its trade surplus with the U.S., A senior economic planner said.     Wang Chao-Ming, vice-chairman of the council for economic planning and development, told Reuters Taiwan would further reduce import tariffs on 1,700 products sometime in the second half of this year.     Cuts of up to 50 pct on those items were made last year and Wang said further cuts would go much deeper.     "We have to speed up liberalisation and cut import tariffs faster and more substantially," he said.     The United States, Taiwan\\\'s main trading p"artner, has said the island\'s import tariffs, still ranging from a "high of almost 60 pct, were unacceptable. It has criticised the cut"s as too selective.      Taiwan\'s trade surplus with the United St"ates hit 13.6 billion dlrs last year. The surplus has boosted foreign exchange reserves to 50 billion dlrs, which Wang said made Taiwan a target for U.S. Protectionism.     Wang said the trade surplus" and the reserves weakened Taiwan\'s position in talks with Washingt"on over export quotas, particularly for shoes, textiles and machine" tools which are among the island\'s main export-earners.     A spe"cial Taiwanese trade delegation leaves for Washington tomorrow to try to renegotiate an agreement signed last year limiting exports of" Taiwan textiles.     Under the accord, Taiwan\'s textile export gro"wth was limited to 0.5 pct each year until 1988. Taipei has said it is losing markets to South Korea and Hong Kong which were given more generous terms.  REUTER... \\x03'

S'French state-owned chemicals group Rhone-Poulenc <RHON.PA> said it will increase its capital with a 2.5 billion franc issue of preferential investment certificates on March 9.     Company chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou said 500 mln francs of the issue will be placed in the U.S. Details of the issue will be announced by Finance Minister Edouard Balladur on March 6.     The group, due to be privatised at an unspecified date, said in January it was planning a capital increase to pursue its development strategy and make further acquisitions.     Rhone-Poulenc shares were suspended from trading on the P"aris Bourse last Thursday ahead of the capital increase. The group\'"s capital currently stands at 4.03 billion francs.     Fourtou, speaking at a news conference, did not give details of acquisitions the company planned for 1987.     He said acquisitions in 1987 would complement an industrial investment program of around five billion francs, and research spending of about 3.5 billion francs. Rhone-Poulenc spent 5.5 billion francs on acquisitions last year.     "Chemistry is on the move and we face opportunities that must be seized," Fourtou said.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Hutchison Whampoa Ltd <HWHH.HK> expects satisfactory profits in 1987 and will pay a higher dividend for the year, chairman Li Ka-shing said.     He did not make any specific projections for the company"\'s earnings this year but he said the firm will pay a dividend of "not less than 32.5 cents per share after a proposed four-for-one stock split and a one-for-four bonus issue.     It paid total dividends of 1.30 dlrs per share last year, equal to 26 cents per share, adjusting for the bonus and share split.     Hutchison, which has operations ranging from trading to property and container terminals, earlier reported after-tax profits of 1.62 billion dlrs against 1.19 billion dlrs in 1985.     The 1986 total excluded extraordinary gains of 563 mln dlrs, partly from the sale of some of its stake in the South China Morning Post, the leading English language newspaper, compared with 369 mln dlrs the previous year. It said it expects another 277 mln dlr gain in 1987 from the sale of the remaining "shares.     Li said Hong Kong\'s property market remains strong whil"e its economy is performing better than forecast with its largely export-led growth.     Gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct last year against an initial government projection of 4.5 pct. "    But he said Hong Kong\'s large trade deficit with the U.S. May r"esult in protectionist measures that will adversely affect the Brit"ish colony.     He said all of the company\'s major operations showe"d improved results in 1986.     Hutchison said earlier it will sell its entire 23.5 pct interest in Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd <HKEH.HK> to <Cavendish International Holdings Ltd>, itself a spin-off from Hongkong Electric.     Under a reorganisation announced separately, Hongkong Electric will spin off all its non-electricity related activities into Cavendish, which will be listed on the local stock exchange. Hongkong Electric shareholders will receive one share in Cavendish for every Hongkong Electric share.     Cavendish will buy the 348.2 mln Hongkong Electric shares from Hutchison by issuing 975 mln new shares.     The spin-off and the sale of Hongkong Electric shares will give Hutchison a 53 pct stake in Cavendish.     Li said the decision to spin-off Cavendish is to relieve Hongkong Electric of public criticism of the power company for making risky investments. But he denied there was pressure from the government for the spin-off.     He said Cavendish will have seven billion dlrs of assets and will be almost debt free, with 340 mln dlrs of liabilites. Its major assets are the Hong Kong Hilton Hotel, property development, and interests in Husky Oil Ltd <HYO.TO> of Canada and Pearson Plc <PSON.L> of Britain.  REUTER \\x03'

S'The French inflation rate is expected to show a substantial improve"ment in February after January\'s very high 0.9 pct monthly rate, Fi"nance Minister Edouard Balladur said.     He told a French television interviewer that half of the high January rise, which took year on year inflation that month to three pct, was due to higher oil prices.     "Now, taking account of this inflation index, our forecast for price rises this year is two and a half pct," he said.     Balladur said the upward revision of the inflation target, which the government had initially set at two pct for this year, should not affect wage expectations for this year.     "There is no reason to envisage a change in our wage policy," he said, referring to the g"overnment\'s aim of holding public sector wage increases to three pc"t this year.     Price inflation last year fell to 2.1 pct from 4.7 pct in 1985.  REUTER \\x03'

S'The U.S. economy continued to expand in February, but at a slower pace than in January which saw a spurt of activity, the National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) said in a report.     The" Association\'s composite survey index declined to 51.9 pct in Febru"ary from 55.8 pct in January, the NAPM said. It was the seventh consecutive month in which this leading indicator was over 50 pct.     A reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economy is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a declining economy.     The report, based on questions asked of purchasing managers at 250 U.S. industrial companies, also found that the growth rate in new orders and production slowed in February.     However, production remained vigorous as more than three times as many members reported it better rather than worse.     Vendor deliveries improved slightly last month, but members reported that steel supplies were tight as U.S. Steel <X> gradually resumed production.     An equal number of members reported inventories were higher and lower. The NAPM said that had not happened since August 1984.     For a sixth month, more purchasers reported paying higher rather than lower prices, this time by a ratio of nine to one.     Robert Bretz, chairman o"f the NAPM\'s business survey committee and director of materials ma"nagement at Pitney Bowes Inc <PBI> said "the economy continued to expand in February, but at a more subdued rate than in January. The slowing of new orders should not be significant enough to dampen prospects for a respectable first quarter."     The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, based on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders, production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Brazil would not have suspended payments on debt owed to foreign banks if it had received more and faster financing from official lending agencies, Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said.     He said he would not seek more money from the International Monetary Fund to w"hich Brazil paid 922 mln dlrs last year and said Brazil\'s problems "could not be solved by IMF intervention.     "It\\\'s a question of w"hy the official lending agencies don\'t finance a little bit more qu"ickly and easily," Funaro told reporters at the Brazilian Embassy.     Asked if Brazil would have continued making payments of monthly interest to its foreign commercial bank lenders if official lending agencies had provided more funds, he replied, "Yes, because our country did not receive financing from these agencies."     Asked how long the payment suspension would last, Funaro said "It all depends on what kind of financing we are going to receive from the other side."     Brazil, with foreign debt totaling 108 billion dlrs, stunned the banking community last week by suspending payments on some 68 billion dlrs owed to private banks.     Funaro said Brazil had paid 44 billion dollars to the World Bank and other lending agencies and commercial banks in the past four years and got only 11 billion dlrs in loans.     He said the net transfer was hurting the country\\\'s continued growth and capacity to import goods.     "Something is wrong with the system. Some mechanism has to be found to finance a country like Brazil," Funaro said.     He did not specify what steps he had in mind but said he would like to see "automatic" official lending when needed so that Brazil would not have to dip into its dwindling reserves, now reported to be below four billion "dlrs.     Funaro said Brazil had the world\'s third-largest trade s"urplus and estimated the 1987 surplus would be at least eight billion dlrs.     But he said that without increased and faster lending from official institutions, the nation could not rely on its export earnings to finance development and imports and also service its debt.     "We must find an equilibrium between foreign adjustment and internal adjustment," Funaro said.     He complained that official lending agencies had imposed tight control on credit over the past four years, leaving commercial bank refinancing as the only credit available.     Funaro said U.S officials understand his position "but they don\\\'t like it." Later he left Washington for a tour of Europe and debt discussions with officials in Britain, West German"y, France, Switzerland and Italy.     Brazil\'s central cank Presid"ent Francisco Gros said he sent a telex to creditor banks Friday to" clarify confusion over Brazil\'s request that banks expedite proced"ures for renewal of short-term interbank credit and trade credit lines.

S'American Motors Corp said that it broke off talks aimed at extending the life of its only U.S. car assembly plant after the union rejected its final proposal for wage concessions.     Negotiations, which continued past a midnight Friday deadline, ended Saturday after United Auto Workers negotiators voted to reject the unspecified concessions, an AMC spokesman said by telephone from Milwaukee, site of the talks.     Without a new agreement containing lower labor costs, AMC said it would phase out vehicle production at the complex in Kenosha, Wisconsin, by 1989.  Reuter \\x03'

S'American Express Co, rumored to be considering a spinoff of part of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc, said it is studying a range of optio"ns for its brokerage unit that could improve Shearon\'s access to ca"pital and help it meet broadening international competition.     In a joint statement, American Express and Shearson said the actions" under consideration are an integral part of American Express\' worl"dwide financial services strategy and that the two companies have been having both internal and external discussions on the matters.     American Express said no decision has been reached on the strategic options and that it and Shearson could ultimately decide to follow growth plans already in place.     Last week, rumors circulated on Wall Street that the financial services giant was considering a spinoff of part of Shearson and there was speculation it may be considering selling a stake to a Japanese firm. Analysts said the speculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct of the profitable brokerage firm to the public.     There was some speculation that American Express had also considered a total spinoff of Shearson, but the plan was considered highly unlikely, analysts said.      American Express said in the statement on Sunday that it will not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesman would not go beyond the statement. The company also remained silent last Thursday and Friday, as rumors drove American Express stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring it to a Friday close at 74.      It said it issued the statement on Sunday because a similar statement was being circulated to employees.     Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense for American Express to give up a stake in the wholly-owned brokerage, which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50 pct in the last year.     Some analysts said American Express may consider spinning off part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stock price does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm.      Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of Ame"rican Express\' 1.25 billion dlr net in 1986.     American Express\'" ambitious plans for international growth may be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out part of Shearson would bring. Analysts speculated that all of Shearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs.     To some however, the need for added capital is puzzling. "(American) Express is in a position where they can raise capital if they need to," said Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities.     Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization of Shearson management Wednesday. Chief operating officer Jeffrey Lane got the added, previously vacant, post of president.      The reorganization also created four new positions for chair"men of Shearson\'s operating divisions, a move analysts speculated w"ould allow Shearson to be a stand alone company.      Analysts, contacted on Sunday said the statement does little to clarify last wee"k\'s market speculation. It does confirm, however, that the financia"l services firm, which unsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a major acquisition last year, is looking beyond its own walls for growth and positioning in the global market competition.     "Late last year, Shearson\'s takeover offer to the E.F. Hutton Group "Inc was rejected by Hutton, and analysts said there had been speculation that Shearson also was rebuffed when it approached another major Wall Street brokerage.          Reuter \\x03'

S'Switzerland recorded last year its first overall surplus in government finances since 1974, ending with a net gain worth 905 mln Swiss francs, the Finance Ministry said.     The surplus, including cash transactions and long-term investments, contrasted with the 1985 shortfall of 1.06 billion francs and the 297 mln franc deficit proposed in the 1986 budget.     All categories of revenues were higher than forecast, and expenditures were 433 mln francs under forecast.     The Finance Ministry said expenditures totalled 23.18 billion francs against 22.88 billion in 1985 and the 23.61 billion proposed in the original 1986 budget.     Tax receipts, at 25.11 billion, were well above the 1985 figure of 22.19 billion and the forecast for 1986 of 23.71 billion. This left a surplus on cash transactions totalling 1.94 billion francs against a forecast 102 mln and the 1985 deficit of 696 mln.     Income and wealth taxes ended 749 mln francs above forecast, 378 mln of which came from higher than expected receipts on the stamp duty on financial market transactions.     Taxes on comsumption brought in 638 mln francs more than planned and other taxes 16 mln francs more, the ministry said.     The ministry said the improvement in the overall account reflected years of efforts by the government and parliament to introduce saving and the acceptance by people of necessary tax increases. But economic factors, including the low rate of inflation, the weak dollar, falling interest rates and low oil prices were also important factors.     A spokesman for the ministry said the government had used its improved cash position to retire about one billion francs of government debt, which accounted for the difference between the 1.94 billion surplus on cash transactions and the 905 mln franc overall surplus.

S'Apple Computer Inc today will announce the addition of two new machines to its profitable Macintosh line of personal computers, both aimed at the business market.     The Macintosh was first introduced in January 1984 and has been upgraded several times since then. Both of the new machines, the Macintosh SE and the Macintosh II, will be faster and more versatile, but considerably more expensive than earlier models.     The Mac SE (SE stands for "system expansion"), which Apple says will operate 15-20 pct faster than its current Mac Plus, goes on sale today. It carries a suggested retail price ranging from 2,899 to 3,699 dlrs depending on its features.     The Mac II, designed to run about four times faster than the Mac Plus, is to be ready for shipping in May and priced between 4,798 and 6,998 dlrs.     Mac Plus, which went on the market one year ago, sells for about 2,200 dlrs.     Both new computers are to be unveiled at the AppleWorld Conference in Los Angeles.     Company officials expressed high hopes for both computers at a press briefing on Friday, especially the high-performance Mac II which is designed to give Apple an entree to the expanding market for science and engineering workstations.     John Sculley, Apple chairman and chief executive officer, declined to estimate anticipated sales, but he said th"e Mac SE should contribute significantly to Apple\'s bottom line thi"s year. He said it would appeal to the mainstream of PC users.     "I believe the Mac SE will be the product of choice for most people," he said. "My sense is that it will be a real power product for revenue."     Bruce Lupatkin, senior technology analyst with Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco, said he had not seen the new computers but expected the new products to do well.     "Apple has recognized the need for a convergence of computer functions into one general all-purpose workstation," he told Reuters. "The graphics interface on the Mac products is significantly better than anything IBM has to date."     International Business Machines is expected to announce updated personal computers this spring.     The Mac II uses the new Motorola 68020 microprocessor, an "open architecture" that allows for the addition of numerous peripheral devices, a built-in hard disk and one megabyte of memory, expandable to eight megabytes. It can be equipped with a 12-inch monochrome or a 13-inch color monitor.     In a demonstration of its speed and power, company executives said they thought the Mac II would push the development of software for Apple computers in new directions that could include sophisticated video editing, electronic mail systems and sound reproduction suitable for studio use.     The Mac II can be upgraded so that its monitor displays 256 colors or shades of gray.     The Mac SE is built around the 68000 microprocessor and will be shipped with one megabyte RAM, expandable to four megabytes, and a nine-inch monochrome screen.     Both new computers have two optional keyboards, a new feature in the Apple line of products.            Reuter \\x03'

S'The port of Philadelphia was closed when a Cypriot oil tanker, Seapride II, ran aground after hitting a 200-foot tower supporting power lines across the river, a Coast Guard spokesman said.     He said there was no oil spill but the ship is lodged on rocks opposite the Hope Creek nuclear power plant in New Jersey.     He said the port would be closed until today when they hoped to refloat the ship on the high tide.     After delivering oil to a refinery in Paulsboro, New Jersey, the ship apparently lost its steering and hit the power transmission line carrying power from the nuclear plant to the state of Delaware.

S'LL and E Royalty Trust said Louisiana Land and Exploration Co <LLX>, the working interest owner for its oil and natural gas properties, is entitled to start placing all or part of the revenues that would otherwise accrue to the trust.     LL and E said Louisiana Land has not yet escrowed any amounts and will monitor the siutuation to determine the necessity of doing so.  The trust said "If the working interest owner does begin to escrow funds, the effect on the royalties paid to the trust would be significant."  Royalties from th"e properties are the trust\'s only source of income.     The trust ""said independent petroleum engineers\' preliminary annual estimates "of future net revenues and the discounted present value of future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves attributable to properties in which the trust has an interest are off 64 pct and 56 pct respectively from those estimated in 1986 due to the drop in oil and natural gas prices.     It said, however, that oil and natural gas reserves have actually increased in physical amount.  The cost estimates reflect prices and costs only through September 30.     The trust said using the September figures, the engineers determined estimated future net revenues to the trust from total proved reserves of about 57 mln dlrs.  Usingprices received in January 1987, however, it said the estimate would have been about 87 mln dlrs.  LL and E noted that there has been some weakening in prices since January.     The trust said the most significant portion of the drop in estimated future revenues cale from the Jay Field in Alabama and Florida, a fall to seven mln dlrs from 92 mln dlrs in 1986, as prices recieved from Jay in September were near production costs after expenses of nitrogen injection.

The company said on February 20, 1986, its predecessor Nolex Development Inc acquired Burdett Publications Inc in an exchange of 17 mln common shares for all Burdett Publications shares, but the transaction was not qualified with the California Department of Corporations.     As a result, it said, the former Burdett Publications owners have a claim for damages against Dale Burdett as successor to Nolex for one yuear starting January 21, 1987, with the damages measured by the difference in values of shares exchanged plus interest from February 20, 1986.

S'New Jersey-based overnight messenger Purolator Courier Corp said it has agreed to be acquired for about 265 mln dlrs by a company form"ed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers of Purolator\'s U.S. "courier business.     Analysts have said that Purolator has been for sale for some time. Purolator announced earlier it was mulling a takeover bid, but analysts wrongly predicted the offer was from another courier company.     Hutton LBO, a wholly owned subsidiary of E.F. Hutton Group Inc, will be majority owner of the company.     Hutton said the acquiring company, PC Acquisition Inc, is paying 35" dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of Purolator\'s stock in a tender of"fer to begin Thursday. The rest of the shares will be purchased for securities and warrants to buy stock in a subsidiary of PC Acquisi"tion, containing Purolator\'s U.S. courier operations.     If all t"he shares of Purolator are tendered, shareholders would receive for each share 29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in debentures, and a warrant to buy shares in a subsidiary of PC Acquisition containing the U.S. courier operations.     Hutton said in the merger shareholders would get 46 mln dlrs aggregate amount of guaranteed debentures due 2002 of PC Acquisition and warrants to buy 15 pct of the common stock of the PC courier subsidiary. Hutton said the company has valued the" warrants at two to three dlrs per share.     Purolator\'s stock pri"ce closed at 35.125 dlrs on Friday. While some analysts estimated the company was worth in the mid 30s, at least one said it would be worth 38 to 42 dlrs.     This follows sales of two other Purolator units. It agreed recently to sell its Canadian Courier unit to Onex Capital for 170 mln dlrs, and previously sold its auto filters business.     Purolator retains its Stant division, which makes closure caps for radiators and gas tanks. A Hutton spokesman said the fi"rm is reviewing its options on Stant.     Purolator\'s courier busin"ess has been lagging that of its U.S. rivals because of the high price it paid in the past several years to add air delivery to its ground fleet.     E.F. Hutton will provide 279 mln dlrs of its funds to complete the transaction. This so-called "bridge" financing will be replaced later with long-term debt most likely in the form of bank loans, Hutton said. Hutton LBO is committed to keeping the courier business, its president Warren Idsal said.     "Purolator lost 120 mln dlrs over the last two years largely due to U.S. courier operations, which we believe the management is turning around. We belive it will be a very serious competitor in the future," said Idsal.     William Taggart, chief executive officer of U.S. Courier division, will be chief executive officer of the new company.     The tender offer will be conditioned on a minimum of two thirds of the common stock being tendered and not withdrawn to the expiration of the offer as well as certain other conditions.     The offer will begin Thursday, subject to clearances from the staff of the Interstate Commerce Commission and will expire 20 business days after commencement unless extended.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Pakistan cotton production during the current crop season (Sept/March) reached 7.7 mln bales of 375 pounds each, up 500,000 from last season, Shafi Niaz, Chairman of the Agricultural Prices Commission, said.     Official sources said Pakistan was likely to use 3.4 mln bales of cotton during the current financial year ending June after 2.96 mln in 1985/86 and 2.70 mln in 1984/85.     They said consumption would increase due to a rise in demand for cotton yarn in domestic markets and abroad. Pakistan produced 540 mln kilos of yarn in fiscal year 1985/86 and exported 157 mln.     The State-owned cotton export corporation was likely to export 3.8 mln bales of cotton during the current fiscal year compared with 3.86 mln last year, cotton traders said.     The traders said there would be 1.3 mln bales of cotton carryover this fiscal year compared with just over a mln bales last year.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Imperial Chemical Industries PLC said it is forming a new U.S. pharmaceuticals unit called ICI Pharma.     Combined sales of Imperial"\'s existing Stuart Pharmaceuticals unit and the new ICI Pharma are "projected to be 1.1 billion dlrs in 1990, the company said.  Stuart had 1986 sales of 582 mln dlrs.     Imperial said it plans to introduce several new drugs, including diprivan, an anaesthetic, and zestril, a heart drug, over the next three years. ICI Pharma and Stuart will operate as separate units of ICI Pharmaceuticals Group, it said.     Stuart Pharmaceuticals and ICI Pharma will have 1987 sales of approximately 700 mln dlrs, about 450 mln dlrs from the new ICI Pharma and 250 mln dlrs from Stuart, officials said.     The combined sales force of about 900 sales people, split about equally between the two units, will be slightly larger than the existing sales force at Stuart.     Regulatory approval for the annesthetic diprivan is expected in late 1987, while zestril, a hypertension and heart drug, should be approved in mid or late 1988, company officials said.     Approval for oth new drugs, including, statil, a treatment for diabetic complications, is not expected until 1989 and 1990, the officials said.  Reuter \\x03'

S'BBC AG Brown Boveri und Cie <BBCZ.Z> said it will omit dividend in 1986 for the second consecutive year.     It said it planned to invite shareholders and non-voting stockholders to subscribe to a warrant bond issue of around 150 mln Swiss francs to be made after the June 2 annual meeting.     The value of the stock subscription rights should correspond roughly to the dividend of 30 francs per share paid in 1984. The company also plans to issue participation certificates with a par value of 70 mln Swiss francs, from which existing shareholders are excluded.  Reuter \\x03'

S'The U.S. asset-backed debt securities market, which grew explosively last year, is broadening and investment bankers say 1987 could see a variety of issuers.     "It is interesting to note that the first two asset-backed deals of the year were done by commercial banks," said Anthony Dub, who heads First Boston Corp\\\'s asset-backed gr"oup.     BankAmerica Corp\'s <BAC> Bank of America unit last week i"ssued 400 mln dlrs of securities backed by credit card receivables via sole manager First Boston. Dub said the offering sold out quickly, mostly to institutional investors.     The Bank of America offering followed a January 16 issue of 200 mln dlrs of similar debt by" RepublicBank Corp\'s <RPT> RepublicBank Delaware unit. Goldman, Sac"hs and Co ran the books on that deal, with First Boston acting as co-manager.     However, Dub said the Bank of America securities were more closely related to the so-called "cars deals" that raced to market last year than were the RepublicBank securities.     "The RepublicBank issue was secured by credit card receivables. In contrast, the Bank of America deal was the first public offering of credit card receivables because we used a grantor trust vehicle," he said.     In a grantor trust, investors buy asset-backed certificates that represent a specified percentage of an undivided interest in the trust, analysts explained.     The Bank of America certificates were issued by California Credit Card Trust A, which the bank established for that single purpose, investment bankers pointed out.     The debt has an average life of 1.79 years and matures in 1992. First Boston gave the issue a 6.90 pct coupon and priced it at 99.8125 to yield 6.95 pct, or 65 basis points over comparable Treasury securities. Non-callable for life, the deal was rated AAA by both Mo"ody\'s and Standard and Poor\'s.     Underwriters away from the syndi"cate said they believed the Bank of America deal was priced too aggressively. "AAA-rated auto paper was trading about 75 basis points over Treasuries when First Boston priced the deal," one said.     However, Dub said the offering sold out quickly anyway.     The Fir"st Boston executive attributed this to the deal\'s top-flight rating"" by both agencies, unlike many of last year\'s cars deals, which wer"e rated by S and P alone.     "Investors receive interest only payments for the first 18 months and then interest and principal payments for the remaining five to seven months," Dub detailed.     Investment bankers pointed out that because the Bank of America deal did not pay principal for a year and a half, the issue had a longer average life than some of the cars deals that were brought to market late last year.     The collateral for the trust includes a pool of VISA credit card receivables, backed by a letter of credit. Bank of America has about four billion dlrs of credit card receivables, making it one of the biggest in the U.S., analysts said.     Last "week\'s deal was Bank of America\'s second foray into the young asset"-backed securities market, analysts noted.     In mid-December 1986 Bank of America sold, via California Cars Grantor Trust 1986-A, 514 mln dlrs of certificates backed by automobile receivables through Salomon Brothers Inc.     Upcoming asset-backed issues include 200 mln dlrs of notes backed by the car leases of Volvo 1986 Lease Finance Corp, a unit of Volvo Finance North America Inc, via First Boston, and 450 mln dlrs of notes secured by sales contracts of Mack Trucks Receivables Corp, a unit of Mack Trucks Inc <MACK>, via Shearson Lehmand Brothers Inc.     The asset backed market, which began in March 1985, totals an estimated 11.9 billion dlrs.  Reuter \\x03'

S'After a week that left his presidency shaken and his popularity at a new low, Ronald Reagan and his new chief of staff today begin trying to revive an administration tattered by the Iran-contra arms scandal.     Reagan and former Senate Republican leader Howard Baker, whose appointment as White House chief of staff won bipartisan praise, will begin mapping strategy to deal with scathing criticism by a report on his failed bid to trade U.S. arms with Iran for help in freeing Ameican hostages in Lebanon.     Among the chores facing" Reagan\'s new inner circle is assessing the damage the 300-page Tow"er commission report has done to the nomination of Robert Gates to succeed William Casey as the new head of the Central Intelligence Agency.     White House officials are checking to see how much support Gates, a 43-year old career spy agency bureaucrat, would have if his nomination is submitted to the full Senate for a vote, Senate Republican leader Robert Dole said.     Appearing on the NBC News program, "Meet the Press," the Kansas senator said the Gates nomination "could be in some difficulty."     Aides said that Gates\\\' future would be given high priority by Baker.     Even though he was not deeply implicated in the arms sale scandal, lawmakers said Senate confirmation of the Gates nomination is not assured and, even if won, would come only after months of congressional probes into the affair.     "He has the smell of Iran on him," said former Nevada Sen. and Reagan confidant Paul Laxalt. "He is a victim."     Laxalt, appearing on the ABC News program, "This Week With David Brinkley," bluntly admitted "the Gates nomination is in trouble." Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn said the odds are now slightly against confirmation of Gates.     When asked on the syndicated television program, "John McLaughlin: One on One," if he thought Gates would be confirmed, the Georgia Democrat shot back: "I wouldn\\\'t bet any money on it.     "I think this report hurts that," Nunn said. "It indicates that the National Security Council had polic"y-type influence over intelligence-type activities and we\'re going "to go into that with Mr. Gates.     Only a day after it was issued last week, the Tower report prompted the abrupt exit of Donald Regan as White House chief of staff.     Regan, the former Wall Stree"t executive and Treasury secretary who has been the president\'s top"" aide for the past two years, was assigned the lion\'s share of the "blame for the botched handling of the Iran arms sale.     The report blamed Regan for the "chaos that descended on the White House" since it was first revealed last November that profits from the Iran arms sales had been diverted to contra rebels fighting the leftist Nicaraguan government.     The two other victims of the scandal are former National Security Adviser Vice Adm. John Poindexter who resigned and Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North who was fired after it was disclosed last November 23 that profits from the Iran arms sale were diverted to the contras. The two, pictured by the Tower commission as the key operators of the Iran arms deal, have refused to testify.     Reagan, who freely admits disliking details, is portrayed in the Tower report as a befuddled chief executive whose inattention let his aides run away with his foreign policy.     That percepti"on has wrecked Reagan\'s popularity and threatened to condemn him to" lame duck status until he leaves office in January 1989. A recent Newsweek magazine poll found that just 40 pct of Americans approved" of Reagan\'s leadership, a record low, and a third believed he shou"ld consider resignation.     After meeting with aides over the weekend and poring over the meaty report of the commission headed by former Texas Sen. John Tower, Reagan is now preparing for a nationwide television address this week to respond to the criticisms of his presidency.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd <CKGH.HK> is expecting strong results this year after reporting better than expected profits in 1986, chairman Li Ka-shing said.     He did not give a specific earnings projection but he told reporters the firm will pay total dividends of not less than 19 cents a share this year after a one-for-four bonus issue and a four-for-one stock split.     The company earlier declared total dividends equal to 15 cents a share for 1986, adjusting f"or the stock split and bonus issue.     Cheung Kong\'s earnings ros"e to 1.28 billion H.K. Dlrs in 1986, well above market expectations of 920 mln to one billion dlrs. They compared with profits of 551.7 mln dlrs in 1985.     Cheung Kong also reported extraordinary gai"ns of 983.6 mln dlrs mainly from the firm\'s sale of the Hong Kong H"ilton Hotel to Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd <HKEH.HK> for one billion dlrs. It had gains of 81.3 mln dlrs in 1985.     Li attributed the surge in 1986 earnings to a buoyant local property market and substantial increases in contributions from associated companies.     "Looking ahead, 1987 should be another year of stability for the property market," Li said. "The growth in (Hong Kong\\\'s) exports is expected to stimulate the demand for industrial buildings."     Cheung Kong is cash rich and is looking for new projects in the British colony, Li said, noting the firm is interested in a land reclamation project along the Hong Kong harbour and is exchanging views with the government on a proposal to build a second airport.

S'The Writers Guild of America said its members have struck the news staffs of CBS Inc <CBS> and Capital Cities/ABC Inc <CCB> this morning after negotiations for a new contract broke down.     The guild said there had been extensions prior to the strike deadline this morning, but said the strike was called after the companies refused to negotiate.     The guild said the companies failed to put a final offer on the table, made no money offer at all, and did not deviate substantially from their original proposals, which, the guild said, would have gutted the union contract.     The guild said the networks demanded the right to terminate employees at will and lay them off without the  arbitration, and the hiring of temporary employees to replace staffer employees.     The guild represents newswriters, editors, desk assistants, researchers, production assistants, promotion writers and graphic artists.     The strike affects unions in New York, Chicago, Washington and Los Angeles. Picketing will commence at corporate headquarters in New York and other locations, the guild said.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Coffee quota talks at the International Coffee Organization council meeting here continued this afternoon, but producers and consumers still had not reached common ground on the key issue of how to estimate export quotas, delegates said.     The 54 member contact group was examining a Colombian proposal to resume quotas April 1 under the ad hoc system used historically, with a pledge to meet again in September to discuss how quotas would be worked out in the future, they said.     Delegates would not speculate on the prospects for agreement at this time.     "Anything could happen," one delegate said.  Reuter \\x03'

Pittston said it agreed to exchange 0.523 common share for each of the about 8,612,000" WTC common shares outstanding.     Pittston said WTC\'s three princ"ipal shareholders, who own 62 pct of its stock, are parties to this agreement. They have granted Pittston the right of first refusal to their shares.     WTC has granted Pittston an option to buy WTC shares equal to 18.5 poct of its outstanding stock. The agreement is subject to approval of both boards and WTC shareholders.     Pittston said described WTC as a fast growing air freight forwarding company with operations throughout the world. Its revenues totaled nearly 200 mln dlrs in the year ended November 30 and for the quarter ended on that date it earned 1.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 55.8 mln dlrs.

S'The Bank of England said it had offered borrowing facilities to those discount houses wishing to use them at 1430 GMT.     The Bank also said it provided the money market 456 mln stg assistance in the afternoon session bringing its total help so far today to 493 mln stg. This compares with its forecast of a shortage in the system today of around 700 mln stg.     The central bank purchased bank bills outright comprising 41 mln stg in band one at 10-7/8 pct 361 mln stg in band two at 10-13/16 pct and 54 mln stg in band three at 10-3/4 pct.     Money market dealers said the Bank of England has recently used the offer of borrowing facilities to signal that it does not want to see an early reduction in U.K. Base lending rates.     The Bank does this by lending to the discount houses at rates of interest higher than its prevailing money market dealing rates.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Sight deposits by commercial banks at the Swiss National Bank rose by 3.10 billion Swiss francs to 10.53 billion in the last 10 days of February, the National Bank said.     Foreign exchange reserves fell 3.06 billion francs to 30.64 billion.     Sight deposits are an important measure of Swiss money market liquidity.     The decline in foreign exchange reserves reflected the dismantling of swap arrangements, the National Bank said.     Banknotes in circulation rose by 834 mln francs to 24.79 billion while other deposits on call - mainly government funds - fell 1.60 billion francs to 1.04 billion.  REUTER \\x03'

S'\\x02 USDA LIFTS CROSS-COMPLIANCE FOR 1987 CROP OATS     REPEAT FROM LATE FRIDAY     WASHINGTON, Feb 27 - The USDA said it is lifting the limited cross-compliance requirement for 1987 crop oats.     Deputy Secretary Peter Myers said the action was being taken to help alleviate the short supply of oats.     Under limited cross compliance, the plantings of other program crops on the farm may not exceed the crop acreage bases of those crops.     The lifting of the cross-compliance on oats permits the planting of oats in excess of the oat acreage base without sacrificing eligibility for other crop program benefits.     Myers said soybean plantings are expected to decrease as a result of the action on oats, planting of which are expected to increase by two to three mln acres.  Reuter \\x03  '

S'Brazil is not happy with the existing structure of the 14-bank advisory committee which coordinates its commercial bank debt, Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said.     U.S. Banks have 50 pct representat"ion on the committee while holding only 35 pct of Brazil\'s debt to "banks, he said, adding "This is not fair with the European and Japanese banks." The committee had played a useful role in 1982 and 1983, however.     Noting the often different reactions of U.S., Japanese and European banks, Funaro told journalists that Brazil might adopt an approach involving separate discussions with the regions. "    Since debtor nations\' problems were normally treated on a case-"by-case basis, "Perhaps the same principle should apply to creditors," central bank president Francisco Gros said.     Brazil on February 20 suspended indefinitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks, followed last week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions, worth some 15 billion dlrs.     Funaro and Gros spent two days at the end of last week in Washington talking to government officials and international agencies and will this week visit Britain, France, West Germany, Switzerland and Italy for discussions with governments.     Funaro and Gros are today meeting British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and Governor of the Bank of England Robin Leigh-Pemberton.     Bankers have estimated that Brazil owes U.K. Banks around 8.5 billion dlrs in long and medium term loans, giving the U.K. The third largest exposur"e after the U.S. And Japan.     The crisis began when Brazil\'s trad"e surplus, its chief means of servicing its foreign debt, started to decline sharply and the problem was compounded by a renewed surge" in the country\'s\\x7fate of inflation.  Reserves were reported to h"ave dropped below four billion dlrs.     Funaro envisaged that any" eventual solution to problems with Brazil\'s 108 billion dlr foreig"n debt would involve only partial servicing of the debt.     "What we propose is to arrive at a mechanism of refinance for part of the service, because we cannot service all that," he said. "I really think we have to change the old rules."     Asked why Brazil was first approaching governments, rather than the commercial banks themselves in its search for a solution to the crisis, Funaro said "We must first talk to the governments and then we can talk to the banks, because the banks have some limits."     "It is a political discussion from our point of view," he said.     Funaro said he hoped next week to travel to talk to Japanese and Canadian government officials. He would then talk to the commercial banks "If I\\\'ve got so"me solution from the governments. I can\'t take the burden only to t"he banks." He was not sure how long it would take to reach a solution.  \\x7f  In discussions with governments Brazil would review the mechanisms whereby finance was made available to nations in need. Finance from official lending agencies had been virtually closed since 1982. "You must open these mechanisms," he said.     He said tha"t while the U.S. Officials had been disturbed by Brazil\'s suspensio"n of interest payments, they understood Brazil had no other choice, as it had to protect its reserves.     Also the financing mechanisms had to be discussed "because we can\\\'t stay as we were the last few years."     "I\\\'m trying to put the problem on the table.... All of us would like to have a kind of equilibrium." he said. Although Brazil has rejected a substantive role for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in managing its economy, Funaro paid a call in Washington to IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus and to World Bank President Barber Conable.     Funaro noted that inflation in February had started to decline again and he expected Brazil to achieve a minimum eight billion dlr trade surplus in 1987.     Banking sou"rces noted that Brazil\'s monthly surplus had declined to some 150 m"ln dlrs in the final three months of last year, against a monthly one billion in the first nine months.     Brazil had the third largest trade surplus in the world, Funaro said, although its share of international trade was only one pct.  "The solution is linked with growth, not recession," he said, noting an IMF program would involve promoting exports and inducing an internal recession in order to "service debt.     Banking sources said Brazil\'s debts to foreign go"vernments, as opposed to commercial banks, now benefit from a sound"er structure following last month\'s rescheduling by the Paris Club "of creditor nations of 4.12 billion dlrs of official debt.

S'A Taiwan mission will leave next week for Washington to renegotiate" an agreement severely limiting the growth of the island\'s textile "exports, a Board of Foreign Trade official said.     Under the agr"eement signed last July, Taiwan\'s textile export growth was limited" to 0.5 pct each year until 1988, based on the value of 1985 exports.     The official said the pact was unfair because the United States had signed more favourable agreements with Hong Kong and South Korea. They were each given about one pct growth until 1991.     He said Taiwan now found it difficult to compete with its two main rivals and the problem had been made worse because of the surging value of the Taiwan dollar.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Stansbury Mining Corp said it has arranged the financing it needs to bring its vermiculite mine into operation later this year.     The company said New York investment banking firm Matthews and Wright has arranged 7,300,000 dlrs in tax-free industrial revenue bonds and 4,700,000 dlrs in conventional bonds.     It said it expects to produce saleable ore from the mine before year-end.     The company said it has also signed an agreement for Wright Engineers Ltd of British Columbia to recoup the cost of its services to Stansbury by converting warrants.

It said it does not expect more than 400,000 warrants to be converted over the next 12 months.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Nuclear Data Inc said its bank lenders agreed to extend its secured loan agreement through June 30, 1987.     The agreement, which covers about 9.5 mln dlrs in short term debt, had been scheduled to expire February 28.     Terms of the extension require Nuclear Data to obtain replacement financing from outside sources before June 30, it said.     If the company is unable to or fails to achieve certain projected operating results in the meantime, it will be required to divest enough assets to retire its debt, it said.     For the first nine months of its fiscal 1987 year ended November 30, 1986, Nuclear Data reported a loss of almost nine mln dlrs or 4.98 dlrs a share on revenues of 32.6 mln dlrs.     Nuclear Data cited improvement in printed circuit board sales and said it is confident it will obtain replacement financing.     In other action, Nuclear Data said it set up a 1.25 mln dlrs reserve to cover the revaluation of certain domestic medical inventory and the redirection of its U.S. medical sales efforts.     The reserve was taken to offset a decline in the U.S. dollar against the Danish Kroner and other factors adversely affecting sales of its Danish manufactured medical products in the U.S. market, Nuclear Data said.

S'"U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson has told Brazil\'s Fin""ance Minister Dilson Funaro that negotiations on Brazil\'s debt to c"ommercial banks are a matter for the commercial banks themselves, a Treasury spokesman said.     The spokesman said the Chancellor had emphasised in talks this morning with Funaro the need for the Brazilian authorities to be able to present a convincing economic progr"am to the country\'s creditors. He added an accord with the Internat"ional Monetary Fund (IMF) could be a very helpful support.     Brazil on February 20 suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs o"f its debts to commercial banks.     Lawson\'s attitude was interpre"ted by banking sources as a clear rebuff to Brazilian hopes of obtaining official cooperation in resolving its external debt crisis.     Funaro, accompanied by central bank president Francisco Gros, is on the first leg of a tour of European capitals in an attempt to "explain to governments Brazil\'s indefinite suspension of interest p"ayments earlier this month.     Brazil has in the past rejected a substantial role for the IMF in managing its economy, arguing that an IMF austerity program by promoting exports and dampening domestic consumption would lead to recession and threaten democracy.     Funaro and Gros last week visited Washington as part of their trip to enlist support from governments for its attempts to change the means by which developing countries finance growth.     Funaro said on Saturday in Washington that Brazil would not have suspended payment on its debt if it had received more and faster financing from international agencies.     He said earlier today that Brazil was first approaching governments before talking to the commercial banks themselves about the interest payment moratorium "because the banks" have some limits.... It\'s a political discussion from our point of" view."     Funaro said on Friday that his talks with U.S. Officials had resulted in no new financial arrangement to help resolve Br"azil\'s debt crisis, describing the meeting as an initial contact. "    He had earlier met Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker and U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker.     The Treasury spokesman" pointed out that today\'s talks had been at Funaro\'s request.     "After travelling this week to France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy, Funaro hopes to visit Canada and Japan next week before starting negotiations with banks.  REUTER \\x03'

S'The National Union of Mineworkers, NUM, said it will demand a 55 pc"t annual wage increase in upcoming negotiations with South Africa\'s" mining companies.     The union, representing some 360,000 black workers at about 118 mines, last year sought a 45 pct boost in salaries and settled for 23.5 pct.     NUM General Secretary Cyril Ramaphosa told a news conference the miners were "very angry at low wages...And are prepared to press their struggle for as long as it takes to get their demands met."     Salaries for black miners currently range from a low of 195 rand or 94 dlrs a month to 800 rand, or 384 dlrs, with an average monthly wage of 345 rand or 165 dlrs, Ramaphosa said.     He also said the union has asked the mining companies to begin new contract talks on April one instead of the usual May one starting time. The current one-year contract expires at the end of June.

S'The Federal Reserve is expected to enter the U.S. Government securities market to add temporary reserves, economists said.     They expect it to supply the reserves indirectly by arranging a fairly large round, two billion dlrs or more, of customer repurchase agreements. The Fed may add the reserves directly instead via System repurchases.     Federal funds, which averaged 6.02 pct on Friday, opened at 6-1/8 pct and traded between there and 6-1/16 pct. Funds are under upward pressure from settlement of recently sold two-year notes and from a Treasury tax and loan call on banks.  Reuter \\x03'

Traders said he raised his recommendation of Temple Inland to a "buy" to support his earnings outlook of 5.85 dlrs a share in 1987 and nine dlrs a share in 1988. The company earned 3.30 dlrs a share in 1986.     Traders also said that Rogers reiterated a recommendation of International Paper, another forest products company that scored large gains in January as the dollar floundered. Rogers expects the company to earn 7.50 dlrs a share in 1987 and 10 dlrs a share in 1988. Last year the company earned 5.28 dlrs a share.  Reuter \\x03'

S'A study group said the United States should increase its strategic petroleum reserve to one mln barrels as one way to deal with the present and future impact of low oil prices on the domestic oil industry.     U.S. policy now is to raise the strategic reserve to 750 mln barrels, from its present 500 mln, to help protect the economy from an overseas embargo or a sharp price rise.     The Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, a private group, also called for new research for oil exploration and development techniques.     It predicted prices would remain at about 15-18 dlrs a barrel for several years and then rise to the mid 20s, with imports at about 30 pct of U.S. consumption.     It said instead that such moves as increasing oil reserves and more exploration and development research would help to guard against or mitigate the risks of increased imports.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Investor Sumner Redstone, who leads one of the two groups vying for control of Viacom International Inc, offered to sweeten his bid for the company by 1.50 dlrs a share cash and 1.50 dlrs in securities.     In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Redstone, who controls Dedham, Mass.,-based National Amusements Inc, a theater chain operator, offered to raise the cash portion of its Viacom offer to 42 dlrs a share from 40.50 dlrs.     Redstone also raised the face value of the preferred stock he is offering to 7.50 dlrs from six dlrs.     The Redstone offer, which is being made through Arsenal Holdings Inc, a National Amusements subsidiary set up for that purpose, which also give Viacom shareholders one-fifth of a share of Arsenal common stock after the takeover.     Viacom said earlier today it received revised takeover bids from Redstone and MCV Holdings Inc, a group led by Viacom management which is competing with Redstone for control of the company and already has a formal merger agreement with Viacom.     The company did not disclose the details of the revised offers, but said a special committee of its board would review them later today.     The Redstone group, which has a 19.5 pct stake in Viacom, and the management group, which has a 5.4 pct stake, have both agreed not to buy more shares of the company until a merger is completed, unless the purchases are part of a tender offer for at least half of the outstanding stock.     The two rivals also signed confidentiality agreements, which give" them access to Viacom\'s financial records provided they keep the i"nformation secret.     In his SEC filing, Redstone, who estimated his cost of completing the takeover at 2.95 billion dlrs, said Bank of America is confident it can raise 2.275 billion dlrs.     Besides the financing it would raise through a bank syndicate, Bank of America has also agreed to provide a separate 25 mln dlr for the limited purpose of partial financing and has committed to provide another 592 mln dlrs, Redstone said.     Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner and Smith Inc has increased its underwriting commitment to 175 mln dlrs of subordinated financing debt for the Viacom takeover, from the 150 mln dlrs it agreed to underwrite earlier, Redstone said.     Redstone said his group would contribute more than 475 mln dlrs in equity toward the takeover.     The Redstone equity contribution "to the takeover would consist of all of his group\'s 6,881,800 Viaco"m common shares and at least 118 mln dlrs cash, he said.     The new offer, the second sweetened deal Redstone has proposed in his month-long bidding war with management, also contains newly drawn up proposed merger documents, he said.     Last week, the management group submitted what it called its last offer for the company, valued at 3.1 mln dlrs and consisting of 38.50 dlrs a share cash, preferred stock valued at eight dlrs a share and equity in the new compan"y. Redstone\'s previous offer had been valued at 3.2 billion dlrs. " Reuter \\x03'

S'French operators last Friday requested licences to export 10,500 tonnes of free market maize, 11,950 tonnes of free market barley and 13,000 of soft wheat flour to non-EC countries, at prefixed daily (droit commun) rebates, French trade sources said.     The latest requests for the maize were for export to Switzerland, Austria and Lichtenstein at a maximum daily rebate prefixed last Friday at 141 Ecus a tonne against a previous 20 Ecu daily rebate.     The special daily rebate for maize was set in the context of a Commission commitment to grant this season rebates for the export of 500,000 tonnes of French maize to non-EC countries, in compensation for concessions to the U.S. in the recent dispute over grain sales to Spain.     If the latest French requests are accepted as expected, this will bring the total of French maize exported in this context to 25,500 tonnes.     The Commission last Thursday granted weekly rebates for the sale of 15,000 tonnes of free market maize to non-EC countries.     Requests for barley were for export to Switzerland, Austria and Lichtenstein, Ceuta and Melilla at an unchanged pre-fixed restitution of 125 Ecus a tonne, while requests for soft wheat flour were for export to various non-EC countries at an unchanged 178 Ecus a tonne.

S'A study group said the United States should increase its strategic petroleum reserve to one mln barrels as one way to deal with the present and future impact of low oil prices on the domestic oil industry.     U.S. policy now is to raise the strategic reserve to 750 mln barrels, from its present 500 mln, to help protect the economy from an overseas embargo or a sharp price rise.     The Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, a private group, also called for new research for oil exploration and development techniques.     It predicted prices would remain at about 15-18 dlrs a barrel for several years and then rise to the mid 20s, with imports at about 30 pct of U.S. consumption.     The study cited two basic policy paths for the nation: to protect the U.S. industry through an import fee or other such device or to accept the full economic benefits of cheap oil.     But the group did not strongly back either option, saying there were benefits and drawbacks to both.     It said instead that such moves as increasing oil reserves and more exploration and development research would help to guard against or mitigate the risks of increased imports.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Union Carbide Corp is looking to acquisitions and joint ventures to aid its chemicals and plastics growth, according the H.W. Lichtenberger, president of Chemicals and Plastics.     Describing this as" a major departure in the company\'s approach to commercial developm"ent, he told the annual new business forum of the Commercial Development Association "We are looking to acquisitions and joint ventures when they look like the fastest and most promising routes to the growth markets we\\\'ve identified."     Not very long ago Union Carbide had the attitude "that if we couldn\\\'t do it ourselves, it wasn\\\'t worth doing. Or, if it was worth doing, we had to go it alone," Lichtenberger explained.     He said "there are times when exploiting a profitable market is done best with a partner. Nor do we see any need to plow resources into a technology we may not have if we can link up profitably with someone who is already there."     He said Carbide has extended its catalyst business that way and is now extending its specialty chemicals business in the same way.  Reuter \\x03'

S'The Canadian government is expected to announce later this week its final ruling whether U.S. corn exports to Canada have injured Ontario corn growers, U.S. government and farm group representatives said.     The deadline for a final determination is March 7.     U.S. officials said they are encouraged by the outcome in a similar case covering European pasta imports. In that case, Canada decided pasta imports, which take about ten pct of the Canadian market, did not injure domestic producers. U.S. corn exports represent only about five pct of the Canadian market.     Canada slapped a 1.05 dlrs per bushel duty on U.S. corn imports in November 1986, but reduced the duty to 85 cts last month because the Canadian government said U.S. subsidies to  corn producers were less than Canada earlier estimated.

Talks broke down Thursday when the union walked out after employers tabled their final offer to end the strikes which started January 19 in protest at planned red"undancies of 800 from the sector\'s 4,000 workforce, starting with 3""50 this year.     The employers\' invitation to restart the talks co"mes on the day a deadline set by Minister of Social Affairs Louw de Graaf for a resolution of the dispute expires.     De Graaf said if the dispute had not ended by today he would withdraw the 10 mln guilder annual labour subsidy to the sector.

S'European Community steelmakers presented the Executive Commission with a controversial plan for the future of the industry which diplomats say it may be forced reluctantly to accept.     Under the plan steel output would remain subject to restrictive quotas and imports would be firmly controlled for years to come while steel firms undertook a massive slimming-down operation to adjust capacity to lower demand.     Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes has proposed the ending of the quota system by December 1988.     He has proposed a return to the free market, which under EC law is supposed to exist except in times of "manifest crisis."     But diplomats said some ministers who meet to discuss this idea on March 19 will argue that steel firms are in crisis in their countries, with orders falling as customers switch to alternative products and accounts firm"ly in the red.     Ministers from the EC\'s major steel producing co""untries are likely to shy away from Narjes\' proposals and could bac""k the industry\'s own plan instead, in the hope of minimising the p"olitical impact of plant closures, they said.     Industry sources "said the plan presented to Narjes by the EC steelmakers\' lobby grou"p Eurofer would retain the quota production system at least until the end of 1990.     Eurofer said in a statement consultants working for it identified scope for closing plants on a "voluntary" basis to reduce capacity by 15.26 mln tonnes a year.     Cuts were still insufficient in one production area, that of hot rolled coils, and further talks were needed.     Eurofer added the industry would need the support of the Commission and governments in carrying out a closure program, particularly with social costs such as redundancy payments.     The EC steel industry has already shed 240,000 jobs this decade while reducing annual capacity by 31 mln tonnes.  Reuter \\x03'

S'The London Stock Exchange said its ruling council has decided to close the trading floor for government bonds (gilts) and equities in due course because most of the business is now done between brokers"\' offices.     A trading floor for traded options will be retained."     Dwindling activity on the exchange floor reflects the introduction of the new dealing system, known as SEAQ, which was part of the Big Bang restructuring of the market last October. Since then, brokers and market-makers have been dealing on the basis of competing share quotes displayed on screens.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Directors of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange will meet Wednesday to consider a membership petition asking the exchange to tighten rules covering trading activities in the widely-popular Standard and Po"or\'s 500 Stock Index futures pit, an exchange executive said.     "The petition calls for elimination of dual trading, a legal practice where traders execute customer orders as well as trade for their own account.     But exchange officials noted this practice also provides an opportunity for a trader to engage in what is called "front-running", where traders enter orders for their own account before executing orders for their customers.     Leo Melamed, CME special counsel, said directors will rule on the petition on Wednesday, but added that a special S and P Advisory Committee has been studying S and P 500 futures trading conditions for the last six months and is expected to submit a complete list of recommendations within 30 days.     In addition to a recommendation on dual trading, Melamed said the special committee will also make suggestions about a possible automatic order entry and execution system for S and P 500 futures and futures-options and rule changes that would alleviate congested conditions in the trading pit.     Melamed said directors are likely to approve the recommendations of the special committee because "most actions of the board are in line with committee recommendations."     CME senior vice president Gerald Beyer said if the" board accepts the member\'s petition this week, a rule change will "be submitted to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for approval.     If the board does nothing, or rejects the petition request, a rule change must then be submitted to the exchange membership for a vote within 15 days, Beyer said.     Melamed also added that if the petition must be ruled on before the recommendations from the special committee are made "it will confuse the issue."     Not all traders agree on the need to eliminiate or restrict dual trading.     Although Jonathan Wolff, senior vice president at Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette, noted dual trading is evident on most exchanges.     "It\\\'s a question of the integrity of the person you do business with," Wolff said.     Futures traders who act as brokers, however, maintain that trading for their own accounts is necessary in order to make up for errors they inevitably make when filling customer orders in chaotic futures trading pits.     "To have an absolute ban on dual trading makes it difficult for a broker to function because of his errors," said John Michael, vice president at First Options of Chicago.     "What it comes down to is the ethics of the people involved," he said.     Furthermore, the competitive natu"re of futures brokerage makes front-running risky to a broker\'s liv"elihood, he said.     "If I ever discovered a broker doing it (front-running), or even suspected him of doing it, I would cut him off," Michael said.     An average broker in the Treasury bond futures pit, for instance, will fill orders for 5,000 to 10,000 contracts a day at 1.25 dlrs per contract, floor sources said.  Even figuring what is considered a typical 25 pct loss for errors such brokerage can be lucrative.     Front-running by brokers not only runs the market risk of an adverse price move, but also the risk of losing the brokerage business, Michael said.  Reuter \\x03'

S'WEDGE Group Inc, a Houston investment firm with a 5.5 pct stake in American Medical International Inc, said it has had talks with Pesch and Co, which is seeking control of the company.     In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, WEDGE, which is owned by Issam Fares, a Lebanese citizen living in Switzerland, also said it discussed the possibility of joining with others in its own bid to seek control of AMI.     WEDGE stressed that it has no current plans to seek control of AMI, but refused to rule out a takeover try in the future.     WEDGE said it has had discussions with AMI management, Pesch, the closely held health care and investment concern controlled by Chicago physician LeRoy Pesch, and other AMI shareholders.     It did not specify in its SEC filing which issues -- selling its AMI stake or joining with others in a takeover try -- were discussed with which group. But it said the talks did not produce any agreements or understandings.     WEDGE said it believes that "some form of restructuring of AMI and its business would be highly desirable and appropriate at this time."     WEDGE, which holds 4.8 mln shares of AMI common stock, said it plans to hold further talks with company management, Pesch and other shareholders.     Pesch last week sweetened his bid for the company to 22 dlrs a share" in cash and securties, or 1.91 billion dlrs based on AMI\'s total o"utstanding, from an all-cash 20 dlr a share bid, which the company rejected.

S'Talks at the extended special meeting of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) on the reintroduction of export quotas continued, but chances of success were still almost impossible to gauge, delegates said.     Producer delegates were meeting to examine a Colombian proposal to resume historical quotas from April 1 to September, with a promise to define specific new criteria by which a new quota system would be calculated in September for the new crop year, they said.     Opinions among delegates over the potential for reaching a quota agreement varied widely.     Some consumers said the m"ood of the meeting seemed slightly more optimistic. But Brazil\'s un"willingness to concede any of its traditional 30.55 pct of its export market share looks likely to preclude any accord, other delegates said.     No fresh proposals other than the Colombian initiative had been tabled formally today, delegates said.     A full council meeting was set for 1900 hours for a progress report, delegates said.

S'The staff of the federal Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to recommend that the Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS) be charged with securities fraud in connection with its July 1983 default on 2.25 billion dlrs of bonds, a WPPSS official told Reuters.     WPPSS attorney Ron English said the system was advised by SEC staff attorneys that the five SEC commissioners would be asked to charge WPPSS in connection with its official statements about its plans to build its No. 3 and No. 4 nuclear power plants in the Pacific Northwest at the time it was selling the bonds.     English, in a telephone interview, said the SEC staff planned to allege that WPPSS had overstated the demand for power in the region and had understated the cost of the plants, which were to built with the" bonds\' proceeds.     English denied the allegations. He said WPPSS" had made no public forecasts of power demand in connection with the bond sale and had never understated the cost of the plants.     "We at all times told the public everything we knew about the costs," he said.     English said WPPSS had no indication when the SEC m"ight meet on the staff\'s recommendations.     The SEC, as a matter" of policy, never comments on its enforcement activities.     The "SEC\'s WPPSS investigation began in late 1983 and the agency\'s slow "pace on the probe has been publicly criticized on several occasions since then by Rep. John Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who chairs "the House panel responsible for the SEC\'s budget and operations.  "   Of the five nuclear plants originally envisioned by WPPSS, one has been completed, two remain under construction, and two others--those for which the defaulted bonds were sold-- have been terminated.

S'The Association of International Bond Dealers, AIBD, said it will cooperate with major clearing agencies Cedel and Euroclear on a eurobond trade confirmation and matching system to come into force by September this year.     The system, designed to give market participants a fast and reliable way of checking whether transactions are matched, will initially cover reporting of confirmed and mismatched trades.     It will include recording additional trade data, checking, comparison and matching any new elements but will only apply initially to delivery against payment transactions, AIBD said.     The AIBD said in a statement it would be responsible for developing suitable rules to back up the two clearing systems when they introduce their new matching matching facilities and confirmation systems by September this year.     Euroclear and Cedel intend to bring a "trade date-plus-one" matching capacity, reporting on a given day on trades entered by 1000 London time, designed to work with a plan"ned AIBD rule requiring the entry of previous day\'s trades by that "time.     The confirmation system covering critical trade data is designed to aid the trader and the settlements department and also reduce trading risks in volatile markets, AIBD said.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Bryson Oil and Gas Plc, a Belfast, Northern Ireland, oil company, said it has acquired an 8.5 pct stake in Cynergy Corp and took steps to help it consider the possibility of seeking control or influencing the company.     In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in which it disclosed its stake, Bryson said it also asked Cynergy for a list shareholder list in case it decided to communicate with the holders.     Shareholder information would be vital to anyone planning a tender offer and is commonly requested by individuals or groups mulling takeover attempts.     Bryson told the SEC it may review the feasibility of trying to influence the management policies of Cynergy, or of trying to gain control of the company through representation on its board of directors.     A shareholder list would also be necessary for a group trying to mount a campaign for the election of directors.     Bryson, which said it has retained D.F. King and Co Inc to work on its Cynergy dealings, said it bought 841,887 Cynergy common shares for 5.4 mln dlrs to gain an "equity position" in the company. Last week, Texas developer James Sowell told the SEC he sold his entire 823,387-share stake in the company.  Reuter \\x03'

The AIBD said in a statement it would be responsible for developing suitable rules to back up the two clearing systems when they introduce their new matching matching facilities and confirmation systems by September this year.     Euroclear and Cedel intend to bring a "trade date-plus-one" matching capacity, reporting on a given day on trades entered by 1000 London time, designed to work with a plan"ned AIBD rule requiring the entry of previous day\'s trades by that "time.     The confirmation system covering critical trade data is designed to aid the trader and the settlements department and also reduce trading risks in volatile markets, AIBD said.  Reuter \\x03'

S'OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman accused "oil market manipulators" of drawing down their own stocks and spreading rumours to give the impression OPEC was breaking its 15.8 mln barrels per day output ceiling, set last December.     Lukman told reporters the aim was to pull prices below the 18 dlrs per barrel reference level set by OPEC.     "People are playing a waiting game to test the will of OPEC by drawing down more on their stock than normal, and this is having the effect of giving an apparent excess supply on the market which we know is not real," Lukman said.     Lukman, Nigeria\\\'s oil minister, said that despite probable "minor deviations" by one or two member countries, "basically OPEC is producing around what it said it would produce."     After OPEC\\\'s price and production accord last December, the market firmed steadily but spot prices fell in the last week to around 16 dlrs. Industry reports estimated the organization was producing up to one mln bpd above its ceiling during February.     But Lukman was confident OPEC would maintain its discipline, in view of past experience. "We have the experience of what happened in 1986 behind us, when violations of agreements led to the collapse of the market," he said.     Lukman was in Kingston as a guest of the state-owned Petroleum Corp of Jamaica.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Thousands of Spanish farmers battled police in this northeastern city during a march to demand a better deal from the EC, protest organisers said.     The farmers traded stones for tear gas and rubber pellets and occupied local government buildings in Saragossa.     In the southern city of Malaga, citrus growers dumped more than 20 tonnes of lemons on the streets to protest against duties levied by the EC against their exports.     Spain joined the community in January last year and farmers say they have suffered competition from EC imports without sufficient compensation.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Murgold Resources Inc said the number three vein zone at its Timmins, Ontario property yielded partial assay results of 1.08 ounces gold a short ton across an average width of 4.2 feet and length of 200 feet.     It said many of the individual assays were more than one ounce a ton but had not been cut.     The company said these results were expected, because the structure was known from previous drilling as a narrow but very high-grade gold vein. Its known length is 2,800 feet and will be explored and tested as part of the underground work, Murgold said.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Chrysler Corp <C> will begin exporting vehicles before the end of t"his year to Europe, the world\'s second largest market, which it lef"t in 1978.     Robert Lutz, executive vice president, told a news briefing: "After a lapse of almost nine years, Chrysler is about to re-enter the European market. And we are here to stay."     Michael Hammes, vice president of international operations, said Chrysler planned to market "a few hundred vehicles" by year end. "By the end of 1988, we hope to reach 5,000." The first cars would be sold in West Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he said.     The European base would be in West Germany, but no final decision had been made on other sites.     The company will not set up its own dealer franchises, but intends to work through distributors who will wholesale the vehicles to a franchised dealer organisation.     Lutz commented, "We prefer to export to Europe rather than manufacture here because it will allow us to take full competitive advantage of the favourable exchange rates due to the declining value of the dollar." "    The vehicles, on show at this week\'s Geneva motor show, include" Chrysler LeBaron Turbo coupe and convertible, the Dodge Lancer ES four-door hatchback, the Dodge Shadow ES compact, the Plymouth Voyager miniwagon and the Dodge Daytona Shelby Z.     Chrysler is aiming for the mainstream European buyer, who appreciates sporty cars with 2.2 litre engines, officials said.     Prior to negotiating a loan guarantee program with the U.S. Government in 1978, Chrysler sold its European operations to Peugeot SA <PEUP.P>. Chrysler now owns 24 pct of Mitsubishi Motors Corp <MIMT.T> and 15 pct of <Maserati>, which may serve as European distribution channels in future, Hammes said.  Reuter \\x03'

S'The U.S. Delegation at the International Coffee Organization (ICO) talks on export quotas is planning to leave tomorrow morning, but will ask a representative from the U.S. Embassy in London to attend the negotiations if they continue, a U.S. Spokesman said.     One delegate said: "If the U.S. Delegation is going home and the Brazilians are not budging, then there\\\'s no negotiation."     A full ICO council meeting is set for 1900 hours local for a progress report. Opinions among delegates over the potential for reaching an agreement vary widely and several delegates have said the chances of success were almost impossible to gauge.  Reuter \\x03'

S'"Ford Motor Co\'s program to introduce air-bags in its compact cars i"s facing widespread resistance from both consumers and dealers, a trade paper said.     As of February 20, Automotive News said Ford dealers had sold only 455 1987-model Ford Tempos equipped with airbags and 294 similarly-equipped Mercury Topaz models compared with more than 100,000 of the standard-equipped compact models.     Ford has projected output of 12,000 Tempo and Topaz models equipped with airbags in the 1987 model year, but Automotive News said the current inventory of unsold cars represents a disastrously high 1-1/2-ye"ar supply at current selling rates.     Most of Ford\'s sales of the" compact cars equipped with air bags have been made to fleet buyers such as the U.S. government, the paper said, with 11,000 having been sold since they were announced in late 1985.     Ford executives recently said their goal is to sell annually between 500,000 and one mln cars equipped with air bags by 1990 if the federal government will relax certain regulatory standards as has been urged by some traffic safety administrative staff.

S'Murgold Resources Inc said the number three vein zone at its Timmins, Ontario property yielded partial assay results of 1.08 ounces gold a short ton across an average width of 4.2 feet and length of 200 feet.     It said many of the individual assays were more than one ounce a ton but had not been cut.     The company said these results were expected, because the structure was known from previous drilling as a narrow but very high-grade gold vein. Its known length is 2,800 feet and will be explored and tested as part of the underground work, Murgold said.  Reuter \\x03'

S'More than two mln tonnes of surplus maize dotted across Zimbabwe in huge piles is posing an economic headache for the country.     Th"e grain, Southern Africa\'s staple, has been bought by the Grain Mar"keting Board (GMB) at prices guaranteed before it was planted, and is costing the GMB about 27 mln dlrs a month in storage and interest payments to make the purchases.     Accumulated over the past two years of bumper harvests, the surplus represents about two years of domestic consumption and is set to grow as further deliveries are due shortly.     Some deals have been made with aid donors, such as European countries and Australia, to provide Zimbabwe with wheat in return for maize sent to neighbouring Mozambique, where the United Nations has urged greater world efforts to feed the hungry.     But transport constraints keep those figures low and the only significant dent was a sale of 250,000 tonnes to South Africa last year.     Because of the costs it has incurred, the GMB cannot afford to give the maize away and the standard 90 kg bags have been accumulating, economists here said.     But failure to find buyers on glutted world grain markets is damaging Zimbabwe, as it needs foreign exchange to finance imports for other areas of the economy, the economists added.     "At present, it is a no-win situation. Let us hope some of the extra aid (UN) Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar called for at the weekend will be spent here," a Western aid specialist said.     "At least this year\\\'s poor rains haven\\\'t exacerbated the situation too badly," he added. Rainfall during the current rainy season has been far below average, ravaging all but the irrigated lands of large commercial farmers.     While this may curb the amount of maize delivered this year to the GMB, the government also acted late last year to slash maize production and force diversification.     Calling for a switch to other crops such as oilseeds, Agriculture Minister Moven Mahachi said an economically-viable price of 180 dlrs a tonne would be paid this year for only half the amount of maize bought by the GMB in 1986, and above that growers would be paid an unprofitable 100 dlrs.     The poor rains have also adversely affected other crops, such as sorghum, soybeans, groundnuts, tobacco and cotton, the Agriculture Ministry reported at the end of February.  Reuter \\x03'

S'U.S. semiconductor manufacturers, struggling to stem a river of red ink, are increasingly looking toward customized designs rather than mass-market chips for future profits.     The market for customized chips - semiconductors designed for a very specific application or product - is expected to expand by 25 to 30 pct this year, compared with only about six pct for the entire integrated circuit industry.      Market researcher Dataquest Inc estimates that sales of customized chips totaled about 4.5 billion dlrs worldwide last year, about 12 pct of the total chip market. By 1990, however, customized chips are expected to represent a 12 billion to 15 billion dlr market, about 25 pct of total chip sales.     More important for their vendors, because they are not a standard design customized chips" represent a sellers\' market, and prices and profit margins can be "set accordingly.     High volume memory chips have become "a perfect commodity market," Robert Brodersen, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of California at Berkeley, told an industry forum.     "The product is interchangeable between one manufacturer and another and customers base their buying decisions almost entirely on price," Brodersen said.      He predicted that, in th"e next few years, only a handful of the world\'s largest chip manufa"cturers (most of them Japanese) will produce memory chips, the standard electronic component found in everything from digital watches to computers. "The rest of the industry just won\\\'t be involved." "    Last week\'s International Solid State Circuits Conference, the ""chip industry\'s annual forum for new developments, seemed to suppor""t Brodersen\'s prediction.      Of the 116 papers presented at the c"onference, some 40 pct had Japanese authors, the first time they have outnumberd the United States. Most of the Japanese chip designs were in the memory category, including Nippon Telephone and Telegra"ph Co\'s attention-grabbing 16 mln bit dynamic random access memory "(dram) chip, 16 times more powerful than anything now available.     The most advanced memory chip described by a U.S. company was In"ternational Business Machine Corp\'s <IBM> four mln bit chip, and IB"M only manufactures chips for its own internal use, not for the open market.     The problem with memory chips is that they are all based on the same, well known design standards, so they are easy to copy and inexpensive to manufacture. Because such large Japanese conglomerates as Sony Corp <SNE>, NEC Corp, <NIPNY> Matushita and Mitsui have their own enormous consumer and electronics product lines, they also have a guaranteeed internal market for their chips, so they can produce huge amounts at a very low cost per unit.     Customized chips, however, are designed for a specific customer, manufactured in small quantities and expensive relative to standard chips. Computer markets are increasingly looking to customized chips because they are difficult to copy, thus making the final product harder to clone as well.     Intel Corp <INTC>, the leading manufacturer of the microprocessors that form the brains of most computers, alerted the industry to its intention to switch to customized chips last fall.     The company, which just reported a loss for 1986, said it will spend 75 mln dlrs over the next three years to turn itself into a leading manufacturer of custom and semi-custom chips.     Intel joins some 275 companies already competing for a piece of the customized chip business but it has an advantage that the others do not. IBM, which owns a 20 pct stake in Intel, has agreed to share the designs for many of the 15,000 chips it makes for its own use. Intel will customize those designs and sell them to others.    " It will also get to use IBM\'s proprietary computer system for desi"gning chips, considered by experts to be one of the most advanced i"n the world.     Intel\'s success is still not guaranteed, however. "Industry analysts noted that it is far different to design a mass market item than a customized chip that requires a close working relationship with the customer.     Intel spent five years and 100 mln dlrs developing its newest 30386 microprocessor. A much faster turnarouond time, and much lower development costs, will be required for customized chips if the firm is to succeed.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Continental Illinois Corp settled an administrative complaint by the Securities and Exchange Commission by agreeing to recharacterize 425 mln dlrs previously reported in the second quarter 1984 as a "loss of sale on loans."     Under the settlement, which was announc"ed simultaneously with the filing of the SEC\'s administrative actio"n, Continental agreed to restate earlier financial reports to single out the 425 mln dlrs as a separate loan loss item instead of lumping it together with another item. The bank holding company said the change does not affect its operating results for 1984.     The SEC stressed in the complaint that it was not challenging Continenta"l\'s reported net loss for the second quarter of 1984.     But it s"aid it was misleading for the bank to split the 950 mln dlr loan loss provision in half, attributing 425 mln dlrs of it to the event of sale.     The 425 mln dlrs should have been part of a 950 mln dlr billion dlr loan loss provision required by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the SEC said.     Continental had originally listed 565 mln dlrs of the loan loss provision as a credit loss and another 425 mln dlrs as a loss on sale of loans, the SEC said.     It was misleading for the bank to list the 425 mln dlrs as loss on sale, which implied the loss would not have occurred had there not been a sale of distressed loans to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, the SEC said.     The bank should have listed 990 mln dlrs as a credit loss instead of 565 mln dlrs and should not have charecterized the other 425 mln dlrs as a provision for loss on sale of loans, the SEC said.     Continental agreed to the settlement with the SEC without admitting or denying any violations, the SEC said.     But it agreed to restate its 1984 financial statements to ac"commodate the SEC\'s objections and to report to its shareholders a ""summarized version of the SEC\'s administrative action against it, t"he agency said.     A Continental official stressed that the settlement in no way will result in any change or restatement of the comp"any\'s earnings for that period.  Reuter \\x03"'

S'Federal regulators said Dean Witter Reynolds Inc, the brokerage subsidiary of Sears, Roebuck and Co, agreed to a censure to settle charges that it failed to fully report cash transactions.     In a complaint which was issued simultaneously with the settlement, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Dean Witter, the fourth largest U.S. brokerage house, with failing to report more than one mln dlrs of cash transactions.     In its administrative complaint, the SEC stressed that was not charging Dean Witter with taking part in a scheme to launder cash.     But it said it found 35 single lump sum cash deposits in excess of 10,000 dlrs made with Dean Witter"\'s branch offices and another three multiple cash deposits made by "a customer on a single day which totaled more than 10,000 dlrs. The total unreported cash was 1,062,234 dlrs, the agency said.     Federal law requires brokerage firms and banks to report to the Treasury Department all cash deposits greater than 10,000 dlrs.     Aft"er examining seven pct of the Dean Witter\'s branch offices between "July 1983 and April 1985, the SEC said it found that the firm reported 1,880,376 dlrs in cash deposits, each of which had been greater than 10,000 dlrs, but failed to report another 1,062,234 dlrs.     Besides agreeing to the censure, Dean Witter agreed to tighten its oversight of its branch offices.     Another major brokerage firm, E.F. Hutton Group Inc, recently disclosed in an SEC filing that a federal grand jury in Providence, R.I., was probing its compliance with cash deposit reporting requirements at its Providence office.

S'U.S. tin disposals should have little effect on an agreement reached last weekend by tin producing countries to limit group exports to 96,000 tonnes in the year started March 1, a government official said.     The agreement by the seven-member Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) aimed to cut the world surplus and boost prices. Following the accord, ATPC Chairman Subroto appealed to the United States to restrict its tin releases from its strategic stockpile.     "We don\\\'t think that (the U.S. government) has a large influence in the (tin) market at this stage of the game," said Thomas" O\'Donnell, Director of International Commodities at the State Depa"rtment. Last year the United States released about 4,900 tonnes of tin to two ferroalloy firms.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Banner Industries Inc said it plans to accept for payment after the close of business today all the common shares of Rexnord Inc that were tendered under its 26.25 dlr per share tender offer.     Banner said its offer for all of the roughly 20 mln shares of Rexnord it did not already own expired last Friday and will not be extended.     Based on a preliminary count, about 19.8 mln Rexnord shares were tendered under the offer, Banner said.     Combined with the roughly five mln shares it already holds, Banner said it will own abo"ut 97 pct of Rexnord\'s shares.     Banner said last Friday that it "had arranged bank credit to finance most of the tender offer and the subsequent merger with Rexnord, under which remaining Rexnord holders may receive 26.25 dlrs a share.     It said the balace of the funds will be obtained through a private placement, for which Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc is acting as agent.     Banner said it expects to complete the merger with Rexnord within 60 days.  Reuter \\x03'

S'The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has concluded that a ban on smoking on all domestic airline flights is not justified at this time.     The department made known its conclusions in a report to Congress, made public today, on a recommendation by the National Academy of Sciences that such a ban be adopted.     "We agree that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke could be viewed as a problem by some crew and passengers. However, we believe that further study is needed before the department can propose a definitive response to this recommendation," the DOT report said.     The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) had studied the issue of smoking on airlines under a DOT grant.     It recommended a ban in August after co"ncluding that tobacco smoke, when confined to an airliner\'s cabin, "posed potential health hazards to cabin crew members, irritated  passengers and crew, and created a risk of fires.     The DOT said more study was needed of the health effects of environmental tobacco smoke and of the concentration and distribution of pollutants on various aircraft types.     It also called for more study of possible changes in aircraft ventilation systems and said it wanted to spend more time considering whether a ban should be extended to  international as well as domestic flights.

S'American Motors Corp said it will take steps to build a proposed new jeep vehicle at an unspecified "alternative location" after the weekend breakdown of talks with the United Automobile Workers union "on a concessionary contract covering workers at AMC\'s Wisconsin ope"rations.     AMC spokesman Lloyd Northard told Reuters that the company will not build its new Jeep ZJ sports utility vehicle at its "Kenosha, Wisc., assembly plant as a result of the talks\' failure. "    "We sincerely regret this outcome, but the responsibility for it rests entirely with the local union bargaining committees," the company said in a statement.     "We will, therefore, initiate the actions necessary to place the new Jeep product in an alternative location rather than at Kenosha."     UAW officials said during the weekend they did not regard the collapse of talks as final after the company\\\'s "final" proposal on a new contract was unanimously rej"ected by union bargainers.     But AMC said the union\'s rejection "of its concessions package means that plants in Kenosha and Milwaukee will lose 6,500 jobs because the assembly complex in Kenosha "will not be getting new work" as had been proposed with a new contract.     "This unfortunate outcome demonstrates the difficulty of maintaining existing working and bringing new work to existing U.S. operations," AMC said.     Asked if the company considered the decision to phase out the Kenosa plant by 1989 as previously detailed to be final, Northard said: "If the union came to us and said they would accept our final proposal, that\\\'s another matter."     But the company charged bargainers for UAW Locals 72 and 75 had reneged on commitments for a new agreement with lower labor rates made in 1985 when the union locals negotiated a concessionary agreement cover"ing AMC\'s Wisconsin operations.     AMC, which last week reported i"ts first profitable quarter in two years, said it wanted a contract for the plants with labor rates and work rules comparable to agreements between the UAW and Japanese automakers operating in the U.S.     Wall Street investors reacted to the AMC-UAW impasse by drivi"ng down AMC\'s stock price. In active trading, AMC was off 3/8 to 3-""1/2, a 9.7 pct decline since Friday\'s close.      Reuter \\x03"'

S'Deputy oil ministers of the six-nation Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) ended a meeting here after discussing co-ordination and co-operation in the oil field, the Bahrain-based Gulf News Agency (GNA) said.     The deputy ministers, who declined to talk to reporters on the outcome of the 90 minute formal session, later concluded a round of informal talks.     The GCC groups four OPEC members -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates --  and non-OPEC nations Bahrain and Oman.     Before the formal session had begun", chairman Yousef Shirawi, Bahrain\'s Development and Industry Minis"ter, told reporters the gathering was a follow-up to talks held last Sunday in Qatar at full ministerial level.     GNA gave no details on the outcome of today\\\'s talks.     It said only, "The deputy ministers discussed current developments in the oil market, particularly those relating to production and prices."     The meeting in" Qatar had reaffirmed the six Gulf Arab countries\' commitment to OP""EC\'s pricing and production accord forged in December last year.  "   It also discussed ways of marketing crude oil on behalf of those GCC states encountering resistance to official OPEC prices.     Oil industry sources have said Qatar has faced particular difficulty in selling its full quota of production.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Apple Computer Inc and AST Research Inc said they are offering two "products that allow MS-DOS software compatibility with Apple\'s new "Macintosh SE and Macintosh II.     "Apple understands the importance of information sharing in multiple vendor environments," said Apple Chairman John Sculley, at a seminar where the new products were released.     The products allow the new Macintosh computers to run MS-DOS applications in a window at the speed of an IBM PC-XT and IBM PC-AT.     The products will require an external MS-DOS drive, which Apple also announced today.     Apple also introduced a host of other products, including storage devices, memory upgrade kits, keyboards and two display monitors.     In addition, it announced jointly with Dow Jones and Co <DJ> and MCI Communications Corp <MCIC> new electronic mail software, called Desktop Express, that lets users send graphic documents over telephone wires.

S'The major U.S. Government bond brokers are likely to give in to pressure from regulators and investors within the next 18 months, making their direct-dealing screens available to many of those firms that are not now eligible to receive them, said Richard Lacy, Chairman of Exco International Inc.     Earlier today, Exco said it purchased an 80 pct interest in RMJ Holdings Corp, one of the largest of the four bond brokers that dominate the business.     In a telephone interview, Lacy said "Within 18 months, we think the number of players will be expanded."     Currently, the four major brokers will sell their direct-dealing screens to only primary dealers in U.S. Government securities or those that have applied to the Federal Reserve Bank of New york to become a primary dealer.     The U.S. Justice department is looking into whether limiting access to the screens to just a small group of dealers is a violation of U.S. Anti-trust laws.     Primary dealers, of which there are now 40, are an elite group of firms approved to buy Treasury securities directly from the Fed.     But Lacy said that any agreement to expand access" to the brokers\' direct-dealing screens is likely to be not as far"-reaching as some would like. Instead of making screens available to any firm willing to pay for one, he said, it is more likely that a "second tier" will be established.     He also said that RMJ is not willing to break away from the group of bond brokers and be the only firm to make its screens widely available to any one who wants them.     Bond market sources had speculated that RMJ is better prepared to offer its services nationwide than its three major competitors.     Lacy also said that he does not see any immediate pressure for a further cut in commissions paid on bond transactions any time soon. In late 1985, transaction fees paid to brokers were cut in half to 39 dlrs per mln dlr transaction from 78 dlrs.     Some U.S. primary bond dealers have been suggesting that with further increases in transaction volume, fees can be cut without hurting the b"rokers\' profits.  REUTER \\x03"'

S'European Community, EC, agriculture ministers struggled today to finalise new rules aimed at limiting sales into public cold stores of unwanted butter at high guaranteed EC prices, diplomats said.     The plan is the key element in a landmark accord to cut dairy output by 9.5 pct over two years agreed in outline last December after virtually nine days of non-stop negotiations.     The accord, which is due to operate from the start of the new milk marketing year on April 1, was hailed as the most significant step in an on-going campaign to reform costly EC farm policies and cut embarrassing food surpluses.     Diplomats say the December agreement itself is not threatened but that its effect could be considerably weakened if the proposals are altered too radically.     West Germany and Ireland" are opposed to proposed limits on a farmer\'s now automatic right t"o sell surplus butter into public stores when market prices and stocks are high.     Faced with a butter "mountain" of a record 1.2 mln tonnes costing over two mln dlrs per day just to store, EC farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen says farmers must be encouraged to cut production to meet demand.     He is keen to reach an agreement on the milk problem before the ministers move on to consider this ye"ar\'s annual price review which proposes extending the new system fo"r butter sales to other sectors such as cereals.

S'Sears, Roebuck and Co said it will restructure its distribution operations, resulting in a 20 mln dlr after-tax charge against earnings in its first quarter.     The retailer on April 30 will close its major Chicago distribution center as the first part of the restructuring. A spokesman said up to 1,800 workers will be affected, with many of them laid off. Some of the workers may be transferred to other Sears operations.     Sears said the restructuring and consolidation will save about 150 mln dlrs by 1991.     Sears said it will set up a nationwide network of seven regions to handle all aspects of distribution of its products.     The closing of the Chicago plant will be followed by the shutdown of four other distribution units over the next several years. Distribution centers will be closed in Boston, Atlanta, Memphis and Minneapolis, with the Boston shutdown coming early next year. No other closings are planned before 1989.     A spokesman said that, while there will be layoffs at those facilities, the company does not yet know how many workers will "be let go.     Sears\' distribution will be consolidated under regio"nal management in Columbus, Ohio, Dallas, Greensboro, N.C., Jacksonville, Fla., Kansas City, Mo., Los Angeles and Philadelphia. However, Sears said it will also evaluate the productivity of the Los Angeles and Philadelphia facilities "to determine whether they will be modernized or relocated."     Responsibility for ordering distribution center inventory will be centralized in Chicago.  Reuter \\x03'

S'"Versatile Corp\'s shipbuilding subsidiary has a letter of intent to "build a 320 mln dlr polar icebreaker for the Canadian coast guard, Transport Minister John Crosbie said.     In a Vancouver address, Crosbie said Versatile Pacific Shipyards Inc was the low bidder to build the Arctic Class 8 icebreaker, but the company must meet certain financial and engineering conditions before the contract is awarded.     The government also announced it will provide up to 13 mln dlrs in loan insurance to help Versatile prepare for the construction of the vessel. said before the contract can be awarded Versatile "will be required to offer assurances that the shipyard is technically and financially capable of performing the work."     Crosi"bie said Versatile\'s bid was 100 mln dlrs lower than competing bidd"ers and will generate 1,000 person years of direct employment.     Work on the vessel, which Crosbie said would be the most powerful icebreaker in the world, would begin next year and completed in 1992.     The government announced plans to build the icebreaker last "year following the controversial passage of the U.S. Coast Guard\'s "vessel, the Polar Sea, through the disputed Northwest Passage. The U.S. government did not seek permission for the journey, claiming the area was an international water way.     The government said the" icebreaker was needed to back up the country\'s claim of sovereignt"y in the Arctic.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Cuba has told international sugar operators who have bought its sugar for shipment in March that these contracts will take second plac"e to Cuba\'s direct shipments to its export markets, dealers here sa"id.     Some traders who have received telexes from Cuba said the language of the message was not totally clear and some believed shipments would be honoured if the traders declare the Soviet Union as the destination of their contracts.     The telexes have fueled rising world prices in the last week and reflect a poor Cuban crop, w"orry over Brazil\'s export availability, and increasing Soviet deman""d, analysts said.     Traders said signs of Cuba\'s shortage of imme"diately available raw sugar to supply its traditional martkets was probably the factor behind Syria calling a snap buying tender last month.     Normally Syria calls white sugar buying tenders for forw"ard delivery, and last month\'s spot requirement resulted in the sa"le of several cargoes.     Cuba in its telex told operators they would not receive March shipments as Cuba has to meet its contracts to export markets, traders said.  Reuter \\x03'

S'B.F. Goodrich Co said it will phase out the production of aircraft tires, missile and marine products and molded rubber products in Akron, Ohio, by the end of 1987, laying off about 790 salaried, production, maintenance and support services employees.     The company said layoffs will start within the next few weeks.     Goodrich said it will continue to make chemicals and adhesives in Akron, employing about 356.  Another 5000 salaried employees in Akron work for Goodrich.     The company said it has not been able to operate the businesses being discontinued in Akron profitably enough to justify the large investment that it has in them.     Goodrich said it will continue to make aircraft tires at Norwood, N.C., and sonar domes at Jacksonville, Fla., and will relocate its molded rubber products business to a site not yet chosen.  It said it will stop making insulators for missiles.     Goodrich said it is prepared to discuss with officials of the United Rubber Workers Union severance benefits for affected employees and issues related to the continued operation in Akron of the chemical and adhesives businesses and to the phaseout of the Akron aircraft tire, missile and marine and molded rubber products manufacturing.     A company spokesman said it does not expect any adverse impact on earnings from the move.  Reuter \\x03'

S'U.S. tin disposals should have little effect on an agreement reached last weekend by tin producing countries to limit group exports to 96,000 tonnes in the year started March 1, a government official said.     The agreement by the seven-member Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) aimed to cut the world surplus and boost prices. Following the accord, ATPC Chairman Subroto appealed to the United States to restrict its tin releases from its strategic stockpile.     "We don\\\'t think that (the U.S. government) has a large influence in the (tin) market at this stage of the game," said Thomas" O\'Donnell, Director of International Commodities at the State Depa"rtment. Last year the United States released about 4,900 tonnes of tin to two ferroalloy firms.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Diagnostic Products Corp president and chief executive officer Sigi Ziering said he expects to maintain the same compound average annal net income growth in 1987 as the company has for the past five years.     "We expect the same performance in net income over the next five years as we have had in the past," Ziering said.     Over the past five years Ziering said the company has had average compound net income growth of 32 pct annually with a 27 pct per year growth in earnings per share. For 1986 the company had net income of 6.3 mln dlrs, or 1.07 dlrs per share, vs 3.9 mln dlrs, or 73 cts per share in 1985.     Diagnostic manufactures medical immunological diagnostic test kits.     Ziering said he expects the earnings growth to result from positive effect of the weaker dollar on the company"\'s exports sales as well as accelerated market penetration. Ziering" said he expected the Food and Drug Administration to approve three more of its drug abuse test kits by the end of the year, which, depending on approval, should also help earnings growth.     Ziering" said as a result of the new tax laws he expected the company\'s tax"es to decrease by five pct to 31 pct of net income in 1987.      Reuter \\x03'

S'Currency fluctuations may reassert their influence on the bullion market in the near future, bullion bankers Samuel Montagu and Co Ltd said in a market report.     But the firm said silver may lag behind gold in any reactions to movements on foreign exchanges.     "O"PEC\'s failure to address the recent decline in oil prices remains a" worrying factor however, and on balance it appears that the market should be approached cautiously," Montagu said.     The bank said the US economy has shown no noticeable long-term improvement and that both Latin American debt and the Iranian arms affair could undermine confidence in the dollar.  Reuter \\x03'

S'The New York Mercantile Exchange set April one for the debut of a new procedure in the energy complex that will increase the use of energy futures worldwide.      On April one, NYMEX will allow oil traders that do not hold a futures position to initiate, after the exchange closes, a transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the futures market, according to an exchange spokeswoman.     "This will change the way oil is transacted in the real world," said said Thomas McKiernan, McKiernan and Co chairman.     Foreign traders will be able to hedge trades against NYMEX prices before the exchange opens and negotiate prices at a differential to NYMEX prices, McKiernan explained.      The expanded program "will serve the industry because the oil market does not close when NYMEX does," said Frank Capozza, secretary of Century Resources Inc.      The rule change, which has already taken effect for platinum futures on NYMEX, is expected to increase the open interest and liquidity in U.S. energy futures, according to traders and analysts.     Currently, at least one trader in this transaction, called an exchange for physical or EFP, must hold a futures position before entering into the transaction.     Under the new arrangement, neither party has to hold a futures position before entering into an EFP and one or both parties can offset their cash transaction with a futures contract the next day, according to exchange officials.     When NYMEX announced its proposed rule change in December, NYMEX President Rosemary McFadden, said, "Expansion of the EFP provision will add to globalization of the energy markets by providing for, in effect, 24-hour trading."     The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the rule change in February, according to a CFTC spokeswoman.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Rospatch Corp said it will have a news release later in response to" today\'s acquisition bid by Diagnostic Retrieval Systems Inc for 22" dlrs a share.     Rospatch earlier requested its stock be halted in over the counter trading, last trade 24-1/8.     Diagnostic said its bid was for a total 53 mln dlrs through a cash tender offer for all, but not less than 51 pct of Rosptach outstanding common.     For its fourth-quarter ended December 31, 1986, Rospatch reported net loss 2,649,000 or 1.10 dlrs a share compared a loss of 627,500 or 35 cts profit for the 1985 period.     In December the Brookehill Group in New York said it had 9.7 pct stake. J.A. Parini, Rospatch chief executive, responded on January eight by saying the investment was a vote in confidence in the company.  Reuter \\x03'

A total of 77 rigs were active of"fshore and 17 in inland waters during the week, Hughes Tool said.     Among individual states, Texas lost 24 working rigs, Michigan dropped by six, and California, New mexico and Kansas were each down by one.

S'A bidding war for Viacom International Inc, one of the largest U.S. entertainment companies, pitted a management group and other investors against National Amusements Inc, a closely held theater operator.     Both sides raised their bids over the weekend. A source close to the management side insisted that timing was on his side. He said if outside directors approve the management proposal, a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholders with proxy material going out late this week. "It would take 20 days from the day we mail," said the source.     The source predicted National Amusements, controlled by investor Sumner Redstone, would need "half a year" to complete a tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that m"ust accompany any change in control of Viacom\'s broadcast licenses "and cable television franchises.     Redstone was not available for" comment.     Some of Wall Street\'s arbitrage players said it was a" rare situation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war. One said Redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted and if enough people were convinced his proposal was superior to the Viacom management plan, he would have a chance to win.     The independent directors of Viacom were called into a meeting today. Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow.     Viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon. One major Wall Street firm issued a sell recommendation. "We think we\\\'re at the end now, in terms of bidding," said the firm\\\'s arbitrageur, who spoke on condition he "not be identified.     Both Redstone\'s proposal and the management "proposal would create a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt. The management plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5 billion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferred s"tock, convertible into 45 pct of the common stock.     Redstone\'s n"ewest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash, a fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a value of 7.50 dlrs, and one-fifth of a share of common stock stock of Arsenal Holdings, representing 20 pct of the equity interest in the restructured Viacom. One arbitrageur calculated the equity in the Redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making the total package worth 52 dlrs per share.     Management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash, exchangeable preferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share of convertible preferred. The arbitrageur said the equity portion was worth about 4.00 dlrs for" a total of 51 dlrs.     Redstone\'s newest plan raised the amount o"f interest he would pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond April 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated. The plan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct during May and 12 pct thereafter. Previously Redstone offered eight pct interest.     Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the management group, led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes, were offering high prices. "Redstone really wants to own the company," one said. Another said management seemed to have the edge on" the timing issue.     Redstone\'s company owns 19.6 pct ov Viacom\'s" 35 mln shares.     A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine what the equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth. He noted as an example that new stock in FMC Corp <FMC>, which adopted a highly leveraged structure last year, inititally traded at 12.50 dlrs per share, dipped to nine dlrs, and is now just over 30 dlrs.     Last week, Viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell two two cts per share from 23 cts. The company said interest costs from several acquisitions affected results.     Shares of Warner Communications Inc <WCI> rose 7/8 to 31-1/8. Analysts noted Warner owns warrants to purchase 3.25 mln Viacom shares at 35 dlrs and another 1.25 mln shares at 37.50 dlrs.     Chris Craft Industries <CCN>, which owns a stake in Warner, rose 1-1/4 to 22-3/4.     Viacom was created in 1970 and spun off from CBS Inc <CBS>. The company has 940,000 cable television subscribers, operates nine satellite television services and owns television and radio stations. It is one of the largest distributors of films and other programs for television.  Reuter \\x03'

S'"U.S. electronic companies\' sales last year totalled 226.5 billion d"lrs, slightly below the 228.7 billion dlrs reported in 1985, the American Electronic Association said.     Despite the decline, the fourth-quarter total of 61.1 billion dlrs matched the industry record for the same period of 1984, the AEA said.     AEA senior vice president Ralph Thomson said that, although the 1986 sales trend was mostly positive with an upturn at the end of the year, the industry is waiting early 1987 figures before trying to forecast the future.     "Many of our companies, including the semiconductor sector, are still being impacted by the enormous and growing trade deficit with Japan," he said.     Fourth-quarter orders totalled 60 billion dlrs for a 3.1 pct increase over the same quarter of 1985. December sales were 22.2 billion dlrs, up 2.8 pct from the same month in 1985.     The association represents more than 2,800 firms that produce electronic goods and services.  Reuter \\x03'

S'"Canada\'s decision to raise the issue of a free trade pact with the "U.S. was a sign of what many see as a new spirit of Canadian self-confidence, a public policy study group said      "It suggests the Canada of the immediate post-war period, when it was a major player in the process of building a postwar world," the Washington-based Atlantic Council said.     U.S. and Canadian negotiators opened talks last summer aimed at dismantling trade barriers between the two "countries, the world\'s biggest trading partners with crossborder sh""ipments of about 150 billion dlrs annually.     The council\'s stud"y said the trade talks, with a deadline of October for an agreement, are the biggest issue in U.S.-Canadian relations.    The study said liberalized trade between the two countries would improve the competitiveness of their economies in world markets and lessen trade irritants which now mar their ties.     The council said "in the past most Canadians have shied away from the notion of a free-trade arrangement, fearing to be overwhelmed economically and politically by a closer association with a country 10 times their size in population."     But at the same time, it added, Canadians realized their domestic market was too small to permit the mass production and sales needed to raise productivity to the level demanded by an increasingly competitive world.     The council said that in the talks, Canada is chiefly interested in minimizing the imposing of U.S. duties against  allegedly subsidized exports.     A recent example was the 15 per cent duty the U.S. imposed on Canadian lumber exports on grounds the shipments were being subsidized.     The council said the chief U.S. concerns included ending curbs against U.S. banking, insurance, telecommunications, and the so-called "cultural industries" - publishing, broadcasting and films.     It said other major U.S.-Canadian issues were defense cooperation, "acid rain" and the U.S. rejection of a Canadian assertion of sovereignty over waters of the Northwest Passage.  Reuter \\x03'

S'"UAL Inc\'s United Airlines was accused in a congressional hearing to"day of locking blacks out of key jobs, but the company said it had made tremendous progress in minority hiring.     The issue was aired during a hearing of a House Government Operations subcommittee whose chairman, Rep. Cardiss Collins, called the treatment of minorities by the country\\\'s largest airline "pathetic."     "It strikes me odd," said the Illinois Democrat, "that the number of white women pilots is more than double that of black pilots, and that white women are more fairly represented in upper management."     United has been under a court order since 1976 to increase its minority e"mployment.

S'Imperial Chemical Industries PLC, the largest chemical company in the United Kingdom, will expand its specialty chemicals and drug businesses this year, and better its 1986 results, said chairman-elect Denys Henderson.     "We expect to shift our company toward higher value-added businesses and continue to broaden our base," Henderson told reporters at an informal meeting here.     ICI today announced the formation of a new U.S. drug company, ICI Pharma, which, with its Stuart Pharmaceuticals unit, it said will double its current pharmaceutical sales to 1.1 billion dlrs by 1990.     Henderson said, "Our pharmaceutical business gets lost in the way that Glaxo\\s (Glaxo Holdings PLC) does not."     ICI\\\'s pharmaceutical division is the second largest drug maker behind Glaxo in the U.K. Last year U.S. drug sales were about 40 pct of its worldwide drug sales of 1.5 billion dlrs, which in turn brought in 27 pct of its total pro"fits.     He estimated that by 1990, ICI\'s pharmaceutical division "would account for about 30 pct of total company profits.     "The drug division far and away brings in the highest rate of return," said A.W. Clements, finance director of ICI, who was also at the meeting.     Henderson said the new U.S. drug concern would basically act as a second sales force to double the exposure of its drugs to doctors. ICI will hire 145 new salespeople by October one.     Hend"erson said the major new products in the company\'s pipeline, expect"ed to each bring in sales of over 200 mln dlrs annually, were Statil, a treatment for diabetic complications, Zoladex, a treatment for advanced prostate cancer, and Carwin, a treatment for mild to moderate congestive heart failure.     Henderson said U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to market Statil and Zoladex, both under joint licensing agreements with Merck and Co Inc <MRK>, is not expected until about 1989. ICI expects to file for permission to market Carwin in the U.S. later this year.     Henderson said the compan"y\'s 1987 results would top 1986 income of 888 mln dlrs or 5.45 dlrs" per ADR on sales of 15 billion dlrs, but he declined to specify by" how much.     Henderson said 1987\'s results would be boosted by Gl"idden Paints, which ICI bought last November for 580 mln dlrs from a unit of Hanson Industries Inc.     Henderson also said that ICI has about nine billion dlrs available for acquisitions. Last year the company made 40 acquisitions, the largest being Glidden. He said that more acquisitions may be made this year but he ruled out an acquisition of a pharmaceutical concern as "too expensive."     Henderson said that in his new role of chairman, effective April one when he takes over from Sir John Harvey-Jones who will retire, the biggest challenge ahead lay in continuing the earnings momentum ICI has established over the past few years after restructuring and selling off unprofitable businesses.

S'Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro flatly rejected a U.K. Suggestion that his country seek International Monetary Fund help in order to facilitate debt negotiations with commercial creditor banks.     Talking to reporters, Funaro said this attitude would not help resolve the crisis started when Brazil suspended indefenitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs in external debt on February 20.     Funaro was in Britain on the first leg of a tour of European capitals to explain the motives of the Brazilian debt moratorium and to seek support for intiatives to improve capital flows between developed countries and third world debtor nations.    Talking before his departure for Paris, he said there could be no question of Brazil adopting another IMF austerity plan after a similar package four years ago "put Brazil in a very big recession."     "We had an IMF program - it simply meant export more and import less. We are not going to go the IMF," he said.     Funaro was reactnng to a British statement following his talks with Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, saying the U.K. Government had no part to play in what it viewed as a problem between Brazil and its commercial creditor banks.     Britain also believed an IMF program would help along negotiations between Brazil and the commercial banks, the statement, which banking sources interpreted as an outright rebuttal of all Brazilian demands, said.     "That was not my impression of the meeting," Funaro said; "But if the (British) answer is more or less like this, then that means nothing is helping to find a solution."     Funaro stressed that his talks in Washington last week and in Europe this week were aimed at gaining official support to unblock lending from official credit agencies, rather than to deal with Brazils ties with commercial banks.     "Since 1982, all official agencies have been closed to my country," he said.     He said Lawson ha"d made no commitments to support Brazil\'s efforts. Lawson would off"icially state his position when the two meet again next month for the IMF and World Bank spring meetings in Washington, Funaro said. "    Stressing there was no binding time schedule for Brazil\'s debt "problem to be resolved, Funaro said Brazil had not come to Europe with specific proposals to overcome the present crisis.     "We didn\\\'t come here to make a cash-flow programme," he said, "We will have meetings at the IMF next month - let\\\'s see what happens."     Neither did Brazil plan a major overhaul of current domestic economic policies, which Funaro said would likely lead to a five pct economic growth this year.     "Over the past five years we paid back 45 billion dlrs and received 11 billion ... This is a very big effort," he said. "What we have to offer is our cooperation."  Reuter \\x03'

S'All major grain producing countries must do their part to help reduce global surpluses and the recent Australian farm policy proposals are flawed, two U.S. wheat organizations said.     The recent Australian proposals were a good starting point for discussions, "but we do not want the Australians to feel they are alone in developing an agenda for discussions" on world grain trade, the president of the National Association of Wheat Growers, NAWG, and the chairman of U.S. Wheat Associates said in a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.     Future discussions on international wheat trade should include three topics -- a commitment to privatization of government-run export trading entities, a commitment to public disclosure of sales and other terms if government entities are involved, and a recognition that supply reductions by the U.S. have kept world prices higher than they otherwise would be, the two organizations said      While the Australian proposals are welcome the two organizations said they are not in total agreement with their assessments.     Australia\\\'s proposals, which aim to reduce U.S. target prices and "quarantine" U.S. wheat stocks, would continue to place the burden of supply adjustment and reform on U.S. farmers, they said.       Other countries, including Australia, have benefitted from the higher world prices that have resulted from past U.S. acreage and crop reduction programs, the organizations said.     "We will not continue to hurt ourselves economically -- and subsidize foreign wheat production -- by unilaterally stocking grain and changing programs which protect our growers," Jim Miller, president of NAWG said.     "We since"rely hope for some type of agreement among the world\'s major grain "producing nations to reduce stocks and restore profitability to agriculture," Miller said.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Gelco Corp said that, excluding the effects of a restructuring plan, it expects pre-tax operating earnings for the year to end July 31, 1987, to be about the same as those of last year.     For the year ended July 31, 1986, Gelco reported pre-tax operating earnings of 14.8 mln dlrs, or 1.08 dlrs a share.     However, final results will be affected by certain charges including legal and investment advisors fees, preferred stock dividends and other costs of restructuring, it said.     Expenses associated with restructuring are expected to be offset by "significant" gains from the sale of some of G"elco\'s business units, it said.     The final outcome for the fisc"al year will be determined by the timing and proceeds from the sale, it added.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger ordered an increase in cost-of-living allowances for many U.S. military personnel abroad because of the decreased value of the dollar against foreign currencies, the Pentagon said.     The allowances are expected to rise between 10 and 20 per cent in many areas beginning this month, the Pentagon said..     Weinberger also is providing for some family members of financially-pressed troops to fly home from West Germany, Japan, Italy and Spain on military transports if they desire.     He said in a statement to the military that the cost-of-living increases "will help keep your overseas purchasing power close to your stateside counterparts."  REUTER \\x03'

S'Chicago physician LeRoy Pesch said he has had discussions with several American Medical International Inc shareholders and sees support for a restructuring of the company.     Pesch said he has discussed his sweetened, 1.91 billion dlr takeover bid for American Medical with several large shareholders, including the biggest investor, the Bass family of Texas. However, the Bass family has not indicated support one way or the other for his offer, he said.     Pesch, in an interview with Reuters, said based on the conversations he held with shareholders, he could not guage whether he had majority support. He said, however, there is support for his offer.     Pesch would not identify shareholders with whom he held discussions other than the Bass family and the Wedge Group Inc, the only other holder of more than five pct of American Medical stock.     Earlier today, Wedge Group, which has a 5.5 pct stake,  said it held discussions with Pesch, American Medical management and other American Medical shareholders.     Wedge, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, said it believes a restructuring of American Medical and its business would be "highly desirable and appropriate at this time."     "That\\\'s the sort of position that I find a large segment of shareholders of AMI really share," said Pesch.     Pesch said he held discussions with Wedge about joining his takeover effort, in which he is offering 17 dlrs cash, four dlrs in preferred stock and one dlr in common stock for each American Medical share. Wedge said it has no plans to join in an effort to seek control of American Medical, but it would not rule out a future takeover try.     Pesch said he did not discuss a joint takeover proposal with the Bass family.     Some analysts saw the Wedge statement as a bo"ost to Pesch\'s takeover effort and a further sign that there could ""be some shareholder dissatisfaction following American Medical\'s p"revious rejection of a 20 dlr per share all cash offer from Pesch. "    American Medical is expected to resist Pesch\'s latest bid. Larr"y Feinberg, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said a management-led leveraged buyout cannot be ruled out.     An American Medical spokesman said the company will comment on the new Pesch offer by March 10.     Analysts continue to view the Bass family as a factor in the outcome of the bid for control of American Medical.     The Bass family holds an 11. 6 pct stake in American Medical, and t"he company has previously said the investors support management\'s i""nternal plan to improve the company\'s performance. The Bass family "would not comment on American Medical or Pesch.     Pesch, who led the leveraged buyout of Republic Health Corp last year, continues to face a credibilty problem on Wall Street because of the long time it took to finish the Republic acquisition.     Republic also has substantial debt, and has left wall street questioning whether financing can be completed for the much larger American Medical takeo"ver proposal.     Pesch\'s first offer for American Medical was made" without an investment banking firm, another cause for concern to Wall Street. However, Pesch entered his second offer with representation from Donaldson, Lufkin, and Jenrette Securities and Security Pacific Merchant Banking Group.     "I don\\\'t have any doubt that the current transaction can be worked out and completed, provided we get to the point where Ami management will sit down and talk in a friendly environment," Pesch said.     Pesch would not elaborate on what type of financing arrangements are being made. He did say if he succeeds in acquiring American Medical he plans to keep much of American Medical management in place.     He said he plans to combine the company with Republic to form an efficient network of hospitals.     Analysts said they do not believe a much higher offer could be made for American Medical.     Byron Nimocks of E.F. Hutton Group said improved second fiscal quarter earnings could make American Medical stock worth about 20 dlrs per share.     Nimocks estimates American Medical earnings for the second quarter ended February 28 could be 35 cts, compared to a 95 ct loss last year.     Nim"ocks said Pesch\'s revised offer is not worth much more than the 20 "dlrs cash offered previously.     But Feinberg said there is a better chance a transaction could be completed because of the revised structure of the offer. "I think it\\\'s much more doable," he said.     Analysts have said American Medical has begun a turnaround by replacing some members of management and reducing costs.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Marvin Warner and two fellow officers of the former Home State Savings Bank were convicted on charges connected with the collapse of Home State.     Warner, the owner of Home State, was found guilty of six counts of performing unauthoriazed acts -- investing some Home State money without authorization from the board of directors -- and three counts of securities violations in the 1985 collapse. He was acquitted on 76 counts of willful misapplication.     Burton Bongard, former Home State president, was convicted of all 81 counts willful misapplication. David Schiebel, also a former president, was convicted on three of four counts of securities violations but was acquitted on 84 charges of willful misapplication. -- corrects w"arner\'s conviction     The irregularities in which the men were cha"rged led to a state-imposed moratorium on all state-insured savings and loan companies in Ohio, which was lifted on an individual basis as the firms were able to show proof of their solvency.     Judge Richard Niehaus of Hamilton County Common Pleas Court ordered Warner jailed in lieu of 3.5 mln dlrs bond. He set a 1.5 mln dlr bond for Bongard and 25,000 dlr bond for Schiebel pending the appearance of the trio for sentencing March 30.     Lawrence Kane, special prosecutor, said that Warner and Bongard could receive a maximum of 15 years in prison. He said that Schiebel could receive a maximum of 5 to 6 years on his convictions.     All three were accused in the draining of 144 mln dlrs of Home State funds through investments with ESM Government Securities Inc. of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., which went bankrupt and triggered the collapse of Home State.     On Ma"rch 5, 1985, Ohio Governor Richard Celeste closed all of the state\'"s privately-insured savings and loan companies and they remained closed until they could obtain federal deposit insurance or merge with other companies which had federal deposit insurance.

S'Efforts to break an impasse between coffee exporting and importing countries over regulating the world coffee market in the face of falling prices appear to have failed, senior delegates said after a contact group meeting. The full ICO council is due to meet this evening.     President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) Jorio Dauster told Reuters after the contact group meeting there had been no agreement on quotas as consumers had tried to dictate market shares rather than negotiate them.     Dauster said there are no plans yet to renew negotiations at a later date.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Brazil is not happy with the existing structure of the 14-bank advisory committee which coordinates its commercial bank debt, Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said.     U.S. Banks have 50 pct representat"ion on the committee while holding only 35 pct of Brazil\'s debt to "banks, he said, adding "This is not fair with the European and Japanese banks." The committee had played a useful role in 1982 and 1983, however.     Noting the often different reactions of U.S., Japanese and European banks, Funaro told journalists that Brazil might adopt an approach involving separate discussions with the regions. "    Since debtor nations\' problems were normally treated on a case-"by-case basis, "Perhaps the same principle should apply to creditors," central bank president Francisco Gros said.     Brazil on February 20 suspended indefinitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks, followed last week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions, worth some 15 billion dlrs.     Funaro and Gros spent two days at the end of last week in Washington talking to government officials and international agencies and will this week visit Britain, France, West Germany, Switzerland and Italy for discussions with governments.     Funaro and Gros are today meeting British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and Governor of the Bank of England Robin Leigh-Pemberton.     Bankers have estimated that Brazil owes U.K. Banks around 8.5 billion dlrs in long and medium term loans, giving the U.K. The third largest exposur"e after the U.S. And Japan.     The crisis began when Brazil\'s trad"e surplus, its chief means of servicing its foreign debt, started to decline sharply and the problem was compounded by a renewed surge" in the country\'rate of inflation.  Reserves were reported to have "dropped below four billion dlrs.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro flatly rejected a U.K. Suggestion that his country seek International Monetary Fund (IMF) help in order to facilitate debt negotiations with commercial creditor banks.     Talking to reporters, Funaro said this attitude would not help resolve the crisis started when Brazil suspended indefinitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs in external debt on February 20.     Funaro was in Britain on the first leg of a tour of European capitals to explain the motives of the Brazilian debt moratorium and to seek support for intiatives to improve capital flows between developed countries and third world debtor nations.

S'Several analysts said they do not believe another suitor will top the 265 mln dlr bid for Purolator Courier Corp by E.F. Hutton LBO In"c and a management group from Purolator\'s courier division.     Th"ere had been speculation another offer might be forthcoming, but analysts mostly believe the 35 dlrs per share price being paid by Hut"ton and the managers\' PC Acquisition Inc is fully valued.     Anal"ysts and some Wall Street sources said they doubted another bidder would emerge since Purolator had been for sale for sometime before "a deal was struck with Hutton Friday.     Purolator\'s stock slipped" 3/8 today to close at 34-3/4. It had been trading slightly higher than the 35 dlr offer on Friday. At least one analyst Friday speculated the company might fetch 38 to 42 dlrs per share.     analysts and wall street sources doubted a competitive offer would emerge since the company has been for sale for sometime before the deal with Hutton was struck Friday.     Hutton had been in talks with Purol"ator\'s adviser, Dillon, Read and Co since late December, a Hutton s"pokesman said.     Hutton is offering 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of the shares. If all shares are tendered, shareholders would receive 29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in debentures, and warrants for stock in a subsidiary of PC Acquisition containing the Purolator U.S. courier operation. Hutton values the warrants at two to three dlrs per share.     Wall Street sources also said today that a rival bidder might be discouraged by a breakup fee Purolator would have to pay if it ends its agreement with Hutton. The sources would not reveal the amount of the fee, which will be noted in documents on the transaction to be made public later this week.  Reuter \\x03'

S'A former stock broker and an investor who pleaded guilty last June to insider trading as a participant in the scheme that involved lawyer Michael David were sentenced by the Manhattan federal court today.     Morton Shapiro, who was employed as a broker at Moseley Hallgarten Stabrook and Weeden Inc, drew a two month jail sentence and a 25,000 dlr fine.     Daniel J. Silverman, who pleaded guilty to securities fraud, was sentenced to three years probation, a 25,000 dlr fine, and ordered to provide 250 hours of community service.     As a result of trading on information supplied by David, while he was at the firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison, the defendants gained about 160,000 dlrs in their insider trading scheme, according to U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani.     The prosecutor also said Shapiro attempted to conceal his unlawful trading by lying in testimony before the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Reuter \\x03'

S'The New York Mercantile Exchange said it will introduce exchanges for physicals (EFPS) to its energy futures markets April one.     An exchange spokeswoman said the change will allow oil traders that do not hold a futures position to initiate, after the exchange closes, a transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the futures market.     EFPs, already in effect for platinum futures on NYMEX, are expected to increase the open interest and liquidity in U.S. energy futures, according to traders and analysts.     The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the rule change in February, according to a CFTC spokeswoman.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Advance Circuits Inc said it has signed a 9,500,000 dlrs borrowing agreement with Washington Square Capital Inc.     The new loan consists of a revolving credit facility of seven mln dlrs based on accounts receivable and a term loan of 2,500,000. The interst rate on the loans is 2.75 pct over the prime rate, with future rate reductions scheduled if certain income levels are achieved.     It said the entire loan is due March 1990, with monthly payments of 29,800 due on the term loan.     The money was used to completely repay its debt to First National Bank of St. Paul. It would not say how much that was. The bank took a discount on its gross amount and accepted 125,000 shares of Class C preferred stock which is convertible into 375,000 shares of common.

S'The Treasury Department said the United States and the Virgin Islands have signed a tax treaty to exchange tax information and provide mutual assistance in tax matters.     The agreement was needed to trigger provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 allowing the Virgin Islands to offer investment incentives by reducing Virgin Islands taxes on non-U.S. source income, the Treasury said.     The treaty will be a model for similar agreements to be negotiated with three other U.S. possessions -- American Samoa, the Mariana Islands and Guam, the Treasury said.     The new agreement, which expands and replaces a prior agreement with the Virgin Islands, was signed on February 24, the Treasury said.  Reuter \\x03'

The FDA said the drug, tranemaxic acid, would lessen and in some cases eliminate altogether the need for blood transfusions in hemophiliacs who must have teeth extracted.     The drug will be made by Kabivitrum of Stockholm, Sweden and distributed here under the trade name Cyklokapron by Kabivitrum Inc of Alameda, Calif.

S'Kidder, Peabody Mortgage Assets Trust Five, a unit of Kidder, Peabody and Co Inc, is offering 500 mln dlrs of collateralized mortgage obligations in seven classes, including floating-rate and inverse-rate tranches.     Sole manager Kidder Peabody said the first floating-rate class has an initial rate of 6.755 pct that will be reset quarterly at 40 basis points over three-month LIBOR, with an 11 pct cap.     Totaling 53.3 mln dlrs, this floating-rate class contains a so-called catchup provision that allows investors to recapture possible lost interest, according to Kidder Peabody.     For instance, if three-month LIBOR rises to 15 pct during the life of the floating-rate tranche and falls back below the 11 pct cap, investors would be paid back, dollar for dollar, the amount of interest they would have received if the CMOs did not carry a maximum interest rate, a Kidder officer said.     Kidder Peabody introduced this concept on February 12.     The other floating-rate class totals 132.4 mln dlrs and has an initial rate of 6.975 pct that will be reset quarterly at 60 basis points over three-month LIBOR, with a 13 pct cap. This tranche does not have a catch-up provision, the Kidder officer said.     The inverse-rate tranche totals 71.3 mln dlrs and has an initial rate of 10.903 pct. The rate will be reset quarterly according to the formula of 22.44027 minus the product of 1.8097 times three-month LIBOR.     Yields on the remaining fixed-rate CMOs, the balance of the 500 mln dlr issue, range from 7-1/4 to 9.27 pct, or 90 to 160 basis points over comparable Treasuries.     The issu"e is rated a top-flight AAA by Standard and Poor\'s.   Reuter \\x03"'

S'The New York Mercantile Exchange expects to submit a propane futures contract for federal regulatory approval within a few days, according to an exchange spokeswoman.     As previously announced, the Board of Governors of the exchange approved the contract last month. The exchange will now submit the contract to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, according to the spokeswoman.     Contract specifications will resemble those of heating oil and gasoline futures. The contract size will be 1,000 barrels, or 42,000 U.S. gallons.     The minimum price fluctuation for the propane futures contract will be  0.01 cent per gallon, or 4.20 dlrs a barrel, according to the exchange.     The maximum daily price limit will be two cts a gallon on all contracts except spot. Trading will terminate on the last business day of the month preceding the delivery month.    " The exchange said delivery will be F.O.B from the seller\'s pipelin"e, storage, or fractionation facility in Mont Belvieu, Texas, which has a direct pipeline access to the Texas Eastern Transmission Pipeline (TET) in Mont Beliview.     Delivery method will be by in-line or in-well transfer, inter-facility transfer or pumpover, or book transfer and cannot be done earlier than the tenth calendar day of the delivery month, according to the exchange. Deliveries must be completed no later than two business days prior to the end of the delivery month.     Buyers taking delivery of the propane must pay the seller by certified check and the deadline for payment is 1200 EST (noon) of the second business day following receipt of the propane.

S'U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter today said that if the Eu"ropean Community\'s Council of Ministers approves a tax on vegetable" oils and fats, another major transatlantic trade row will erupt over agriculture.     In a statement issued by the trade representati"ve\'s office following a speech to the American Soybean Association\'"s board of directors, Yeutter said the proposed tax would have a severe impact on American soybean farmers, who export some 2.4 billion dlrs in soybeans and products annually to the EC.     "This is an unacceptable situation for us and its (vegetable oils tax) enactment would leave us no choice but to vigorously protect our trade rights and defend our access to the European market," Yeutter said.     Yeutter said the proposed vegetable oils tax would violate EC obligations under the GATT.     He said the effect of the tax would be to double the price of soyoil produced from imported soybeans, making margarine made from soyoil more expensive than tallow-based margarine, and closer in price to expensive European butter.     "I am astonished that the EC commission would propose such a provocative measure so soon after we successfully resolved the agricultural dispute over the enlargement of the EC to include Spain and Portugal," Yeutter said.     "It serves no purpose to embark on another confrontational course before the recent wounds have healed and as we are beginning to make progress on the Uruaguay round (of global trade talks)," he said.

S'Greece, responding to a warning by Turkey against conducting oil activities in the Aegean Sea, said today it had the right to decide where and how to do research or drilling work in the area.     A government spokesman said the Greek position was made clear to Turkey"\'s ambassador Nazmi Akiman when he met Greek Foreign Affairs Unders"ecretary Yannis Kapsis last week.     Acting Turkish Prime Minister Kaya Erdem said earlier today Greek activities in the northern Aegean contravened the 1976 Berne Agreement which set the framework for talks on the Aegean continental shelf disputed between Ankara and Athens.     The Greek statement today said, "Greece is not prepared to give up even a trace of its sovereignty rights to the seabed. It has been stressed to...Mr Akiman that the decision where or how to drill belongs exclusively to the Greek government."     "The Greek government has repeatedly let the Turkish side know that it considers the 1976 Berne protocol as inactive through the fault of Turkey," it said.     The Greek statement said Athens was ready to put the continental shelf issue before international courts.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Leucadia National Corp said two of its subsidiaries have acquired a 7.2 pct stake in Minstar Inc, a corporation controlled by corporate raider Irwin Jacobs and used by him in his forays to acquire stock in companies.     In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Leucadia said its LNC Investments Inc, a Newark, Del., investment firm, and Charter National Life Insurance Co, a St. Louis joint stock life insurance company, bought their combined 1,261,000 Minstar common shares for investment purposes only.     The Leucadia subsidiaries had held an 11.0 pct stake in Minstar, but cut to 1.8 pct, or 313,200 shares, last July.     Since July, Leucadia said its companies have bought 947,800 Minstar common shares for a total of 24.7 mln dlrs.     Leucadia said it bought the Minstar stake to obtain an equity position in the company and has no intention of" seeking control of it.     Nearly half of Leucadia\'s common stock" is owned by TLC Associates, a Salt Lake City, Utah, general partnership, whose partners include the chairman and president of Leucadia and other investors.

It said the securities are available in denominations of 5,000 dlrs for a term of slightly less than five years.     Underwriters are (Levesque, Beaubien Inc), and (McLeod Young Weir Ltd).

S'A special meeting of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) council failed to agree on how to set coffee export quotas, ICO delegates said.     Producers and consumers could not find common ground on the issue of quota distribution in eight days of arduous, often heated talks, delegates said.     Export quotas -- the major device of the International Coffee Agreement to stabilise prices -- were suspended a year ago after coffee prices soared in reaction to a drought in Brazil which cut its output by two thirds.     Delegates and industry representatives predicted coffee prices could plummet more than 100 stg a tonne to new four year lows tomorrow in response to the results of the meeting.  Reuter \\x03'

S'French industry is failing to produce the goods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left the government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the economy, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.     With gross domestic product likely to grow only 2.1 pct this year, the same rate as last year, unemployment could climb to 11.5 pct of the workforce by mid-1988, from its present 10.9 pct, it said in an annual review of the French economy.     The report said the French economy was "increasingly ill-adapted to demand" selling goods at "uncompetitive relative prices on both domestic and export markets."     "France\\\'s poor export performance reflects a geographical bias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average... And...A substantial loss of market share...In the past 18 months," it said.     Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficit to around 2.9 billion dlrs this year from 2.4 billion in 1986, it warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against the franc could lead to "a (renewed) loss of competitiveness relative not only to the United States but also to the newly industrialised countries."     This could result in further major losses of market share, particularly in the non-OECD area, which accounts for almost a quarter of French exports, it said.     Until the competitive ability of industry improved, the authorities would have "little scope for macroeconomic manoeuvre, even if the unemployment situation or the need to encourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow more briskly," it added.     But rising unemployment could help to hold down wage demands, contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a two pct annual rate this year and early next, the OECD said.     Written mainly in December last year, the report took no account of a rise in oil prices early in 1987, and a 0.9 pct surge in January consumer prices, "caused partly by the government\'s deregulation of service sector ta"riffs.     "We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke runaway rises, and it is not absolutely certain that bet has been lost," one OECD official commented.     OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oil prices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in the report, indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast to around 2.5 or three pct.     The government last week revised its forecast up to between 2.4 and 2.5 pct from tw"o pct, against last year\'s 2.1 pct.     But the OECD backed the gov""ernment\'s view that the underlying trend for inflation remained dow"nwards this year, with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over fro"m last year\'s fall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause o"f disinflation.     With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest in the OECD area, the inflation differential between France and its main trading rival, West Germany, could fall to just one pct this year, it said.     On the other hand, the report noted, consumer prices for industrial goods and private services have been rising steeply as companies built up their profits.     "For the disinflationary process to continue , and price competitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange rate stability, it is essential that wage restraint continue," it said.

S'Hartford Insurance Group, a unit of New York-based ITT Corp, said higher worldwide premiums help boost net income for the 1986 fourth quarter to 88.6 mln dlrs, from net income of 36.7 mln dlrs for the 1985 quarter.    For the full year, Hartford said it earned 329 mln dlrs, up from 151.4 mln dlrs in 1985.     Hartford said results for the year were aided by a gain of 46.5 mln dlrs on the sale of its remaining 52 pct stake in Abbey Life Group PLC. For 1985, the company posted a gain of 14.3 mln dlrs on the sale of 48 pct of Abbey Life.     Hartford said total property-casualty and life-health written premiums rose 25 pct in 1986, to eight billion dlrs, from 6.4 billion dlrs in 1985.  Reuter \\x03'

S'The federal Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is looking for possible securities laws violations in connection with an unsuccessful 1986 bid by Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman to take over TRE Corp, attorneys contacted by SEC investigators said.     During th"e takeeover attempt, a unit of Sugarman\'s Giant Group Ltd at one po"int held a 9.9 pct stake in TRE.     It had help in that effort from Jefferies Group Inc, a Los Angeles investment banking firm which sold it an option on a portion of the shares Sugarman eventually acquired.     In addition, a company controlled by Sugarman raised 35 mln dlrs in a debt offering underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc with help from Jefferies, and used a portion of the proceeds to buy TRE stock.     Finally, Reliance Group Holdings Inc acquired nearly six pct of TRE, according to an SEEC filing.     The attorneys, who asked not to be identified, said the SEC was investigating whether Sugarman and other firms with TRE holdings were working together without disclosing their cooperation, as would be required by the federal securities laws.     One attorney said SEC probers also were examining whether Sugarman and Drexel had made adequate disclosures of its intended usage of the proceeds in the prospectus for the 35 mln dlr bond offering.     A TRE spokesman confirmed that TRE, since December a unit of Aluminum Co of America, had been contacted by SEC investigators and was cooperating with the probe.     The spokesman added that TRE Chairman Leopold Wyler had been interviewed by the SEC probers.     A Jefferies spokesman said the SEC had asked for information a few months ago as part of an informal probe.     The spokesman said Jefferies had cooperated with the agency and had heard nothing more since that time.     "To the best of our knowledge, Jefferies is not the target of a formal SEC investigation" in connection with the TRE bid, he said.     A Drexel spokesman acknowledged that his firm had underwritten the debt offering for Sugarman but added:     "We had nothing to do with TRE."     As a matter of policy, the SEC routinely declines to comment on its enforcement activities.  Reuter \\x03'

S'"Last week\'s White House shake-up has increased the odds that Federa"l Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker, a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the arms-to-Iran scandal, will serve a third term, sources close to the Fed say.     But they said that no decision on the appointment, which must be filled this August, has been taken by the White House and Volcker too has not made up his mind.     Former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan, who resigned last week when ex-senator Howard Baker was named as his replacement, was implacably opposed to Volcker and tried often to undermine him.     It is an open secret in Washington that Regan tried to ensure that Volcker, first appointed in 1979 by President Carter, will "not be offered a third term by President Reagan.     Only Volcker\'s" key allies in the Reagan administration, Vice-President George Bus"h and Treasury Secretary James Baker, kept Regan\'s recent maneuveri"ng at bay, the sources said.     Sources close to the administration say Regan leaked a story, quickly shot down by others in the administration, that Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the council of economic advisers, had been chosen to replace Volcker.     But as the adm"inistration\'s credibility was increasingly under fire, it became cl""ear that Regan\'s power to bring about such changes was on the wane."     The sources said New White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the Treasury Department and is likely to respect his views on the Fed chairmanship.     As a moderate Republican, Baker is also unlikely to share the right-wing\\\'s opposition to Volcker.     "This new White House is going to need all the strength it can get," said one source when aske"d about the possibility of Volcker\'s reappointment.     Paul Volck"er is deeply respected in financial markets both in the United States and around the world. At a time when the stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor nations are in question, Volcker"\'s departure would definitely undermine U.S. leadership, foreign ex"change analysts say.     U.S. officials say Volcker works very closely with Treasury Secretary Baker on issues like international debt and global economic cooperation.     The two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate the banking industry, but recent statements by Volcker, in which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation, signalled the politically-independent central bank is coming around at least partially to the Treasury position.     And a recent statement by a Reagan administration official that the two men saw "exactly eye-to-eye" on the dollar was seen as an indicati"on of Baker\'s support for the Fed chairman.     Baker is understood"" to have played a key role in Volcker\'s reappointment to the Fed in" mid-1983.     The sources said Baker respects Volcker and when appointed Treasury Secretary in February 1985, he decided to ensure a good working relationship, in part because he believed the two key government economic institutions have to work closely.     Regan, T"reasury Secretary during President Reagan\'s first term, was formerl""y head of Wall Street\'s largest brokerage firm Merrill Lynch and ca""me to Washington determined to be America\'s pre-eminent economic sp"okesman.     He developed a deep antipathy for Volcker, whose political skills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets took much more seriously.     But the sources said Volcker would have to be invited to stay. "Is the president going to ask him? he wouldn\\\'t stay otherwise," said one. "He\\\'d have to be asked," said Stephen Axilrod, formerly staff director of monetary policy at the Fed and now vice-chairman of Nikko Securities Co. International.     Otherwise, the list of potential candidates is not awe-inspiring. And if Volcker left this Augsut, he would leave behind one of the most inexperienced Fed Boards in years.     Many analysts believe this lack of collective experience -- the four sitting members were all appointed within the last three years -- is dangerous, coming at a time when the global economy is threatened by instability.     An experienced successor, therefore, would seem a necessity. One widely mentioned possibility is Secretary of State George Shultz, whose experience as Treasury Secretary under Preesident Nixon and background as a trained economist would make him ideal.     But Shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-Iran scandal, while vice-chairman Manuel Johnson is regarded at 37 years old as too young for the job.     Other potential candidates include economist Alan Greenspan, frequently an informal presidential economic adviser, New York Fed President E. Gerald Corrigan, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp chairman William Seidman, and Sprinkel.     Long a Regan protege", Sprinkel\'s chances may be damaged by his patron\'s departure from "the White House.  Reuter \\x03'

S'February volume at the Chicago Board of Trade, CBT, declined 14 pct from the year-ago month to 8,191,266 contracts, the exchange said.     A relatively steady interest rate climate reduced volume in the most active contract, Treasury bond futures, by 17.5 pct from a year ago to 4,307,645 contracts.     However, trading in most agricultural futures contracts increased last month, led by oats and corn futures.     Oats volume tripled to 27,662 contracts, and corn volume increased 35 pct to 580,204 contracts. Wheat and soybean oil futures activity also rose from a year ago, while soybean and soybean oil volume slipped, the exchange said.     Major Market Index futures increased activity 37 pct during the month with 194,697 contracts changing hands.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Grain trade representatives continued to speculate that the Reagan administration will offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union, while U.S. Agriculture Department officials said there was no substance to the reports.     "It\\\'s pure fiction," said one senior offici"al at USDA\'s Foreign Agricultural Service, referring to the rumor t"hat the administration would make an export enhancement offer to Moscow in the next two to three weeks.     An aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng who asked not to be identified said there was nothing to substantiate the speculation, which he said was started by "somebody fanning the (wheat) market." Wheat futures strengthened today, partly on the basis of the speculation.     One lobbyist with close connections to the Reagan administration said a Soviet trade team told private grain trade officials in New York last week that Moscow would buy as much as four mln tonnes of U.S. wheat, much of it before mid-year, if it was "competitively priced."     Alexander Ivlev, an official with Amtorg, a Soviet trading organization, told Reuters he had no information to substantiate the rumors of an imminent wheat subsidy offer, but said that Moscow "would consider" buying U.S. wheat if it was competitively priced.     "We don"\'t care if it is EEP, what we (the Soviets) are looking for is comp"etitive prices," Ivlev said. "If they (the administration) are interested in selling it (wheat), they should find ways to do it."  Reuter \\x03'

"It\\\'s 99.9 percent--I guarantee you a strike," Gralewicz said in an interview.     The union represents about 2,300 wo"rkers on the Great Lakes and Canada\'s East and West coasts. Contrac"t talks broke off in January and a conciliator has been appointed to try to help settle the dispute. The current contract expires at t"he end of March.

S'Contracting for future construction work declined by three pct in January to an annualized rate of 236.1 billion dlrs, a report on the industry said.     The report by the F.W. Dodge Division of McGraw-Hill Information Systems Co said a 10 pct reversal of nonbuilding "construction was largely responsible for the month\'s setback from D""ecember\'s higher level.     Residential building eased three pct in" January, while contracts for commercial, industrial and institutional buildings rebounded slightly, according to the report.     Nonbuilding construction, which soared to an annualized rate of 47.8 b"illion dlrs in December when last year\'s only major electric power "plant was started, fell back 10 pct to 43.1 billion.     Dodge said contracting for highway and bridge construction advanced five pct in January. However, available funding for 1987 construction could dry up if Congress fails to act after the Federal highway program runs out of carryover spending authority.     Nonresidential buildings edged up one pct in January to an annualized rate of 77.6 billion. Contracting for institutional structures, such as schools and health facilities, was the reason for the gain, the report said.     Residential building was valued at 115.4 billion dlrs in January", a decrease of three pct from December\'s seasonally adjusted rate," the report stated. However, demand will be strong for single-family units supported by falling mortgage rates, but multi-family buildings will not be in high demand as a result of the tax reform, according to the report.

S'European Community (EC) farm ministers were fighting hard early today to prevent a deal on cutting overflowing milk production from turning sour before trying to agree widescale reforms in other surplus sectors.     Meanwhile, protests from angry European farmers over successive attempts to scale down unwanted Community food production appeared to be gathering strength.     In the northeastern Spanish city of Saragossa thousands of Spanish farmers battled with police during a march to demand a better deal from Brussels.     The farmers traded stones for tear gas and rubber pellets and occupied local government buildings while in the southern city of Malaga, citrus growers dumped more 20 tonnes of lemons on the streets in protest at EC duties.     Towards the end of last week, about 10,000 angry West German farmers marched through the streets of Hanover burning effigies of Agriculture Minister Ignaz Kiechle while in France pig-farmers barricaded roads in protest at falling prices.     Euro"pe\'s 12 mln farmers are furious over plans by the European Commissi""on to cut subsidised prices and severely limit farmers\' automatic r"ight to sell unwanted food into public stores at high guaranteed EC prices.     In the toughest-ever proposals for the annual price review, at which EC ministers set the levels of subsidies, Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen has included measures that could result in price cuts for some products of up to 11 pct.     The plans form part of an on-going campaign to reform surplus-creating farm policies that have become a political embarrassment at home and commercial flash-point abroad and threatened to leave the Community w"ith no cash for other areas.     Andriessen\'s latest package comes "only months after a decision to cut dairy production by 9.5 pct over two years and to slash beef prices by around 10 pct.     That decision, agreed in outline last December after virtually nine days of non-stop negotiations, was hailed as the most significant step yet in the reform offensive, but has since run into difficulties over the fine print.     West Germany and Ireland are objecting to the new rules governing the sales of surplus butter into cold stores, but the Commission is loathe to abandon its position as the accord h"as been used as the inspiration for Andriessen\'s latest package.  "   Ministers failed yesterday to overcome the problem, and resumed negotiations in a bid to finalise the details before starting the price review which is confidently predicted to last many months.     EC farm spending currently swallows two thirds of an overall annual budget of around 40 billion dlrs and is almost entirely blamed for a projected budget shortfall later this year of some 5.7 billion dlrs.

S'Calny Inc said it has filed a multi-million-dlr suit against PepsiCo Inc and its La Petite Boulangerie unit.     Calny, which holds 15 La Petite Boulangerie franchises, alleges it and PepsiCo breached their agreements with Calny by failing to support the franchises in a number of ways.     The company further alleges that PepsiCo and La Petite Boulangerie had fiduciary responsibilities to Calny because of the longstanding relationship between Calny and Taco Bell, also a PepsiCo subsidiary. Calny operates 143 Taco Bell restaurants.     Calny said Pepsico misrepresented the readiness of the La Petite Boulangerie to expand outside San Francisco and misrepresented costs involved in operating the restaurants.  Reuter \\x03'

S'"Japan\'s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to a record 3.0 "pct in January, the worst since the Government started compiling unemployment statistics under its current system in 1953, up from the" previous record 2.9 pct in December, the government\'s Management a"nd Coordination Agency said.     Unemployment was up from 2.8 pct a year earlier.     Unadjusted January unemployment totalled 1.82 mln people, up from 1.61 mln in December and 1.65 mln a year earlier.     Male unemployment in January remained at 2.9 pct, equal to the second-worst level set last December. Record male unemployement of 3.1 pct was set in July 1986.     Female unemployment in January remained at 3.0 pct, equal to the record level marked in April, Au"gust, September and December last year.     January\'s record 3.0 p"ct unemployment rate mainly stemmed from loss of jobs in manufacturing industries, particularly in export-related firms, due to the ye"n\'s continuing appreciation against the dollar, officials said.   "  Employment in manufacturing industries fell 380,000 from a year earlier to 14.30 mln including 1.83 mln employed in the textile industry, down 190,000 from a year earlier, and 1.06 mln in transport industries such as carmakers and shipbuilders, down 170,000.

S'The yen should stabilize at around 152 to 153 to the U.S. Dollar fo"r about a year, the Bank of Tokyo\'s economic adviser Koei Narusawa "said.     "Both sides are showing clear interest to secure stability of the currencies. The major target of the Japanese government is to maintain the yen at above 150, at least for the rest of the year," he told reporters during a brief visit to Malaysia.     Narusawa said the U.S. Is unlikely to push the yen up further because this might spark off inflation and depress the U.S. Economy before the 1988 presidential election.

He told reporters after meeting with President Suharto that present weakness in the spot oil market was the result of warmer weather in the U.S. And Europe which reduced demand for oil.     Prices had also been forced down because refineries were using up old stock, he said.     He denied that Opec was exceeding its agreed production ceiling. Asked what Opec\\\'s output level was now, he replied: "Below 15.8 (mln barrels per day)." He did not elaborate.     He said there appeared to have been some attempts to manipulate the market, but" if all Opec members stick by the cartel\'s December pricing agreeme"nt it would get through present price difficulties.     He predicted that prices would recover again in the third and fourth quarters of 1987.     He also reiterated that there was no need for an emergency Opec meeting.     He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the spot price. "We hope the weak price will be overcome, and predict the price will be better in the third and fourth quarters."     Refiners, he said, appeared to have used up old stock deliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price to fall. But Opec would get through this period if members stuck together.

S'"The government\'s industry aid and protection review body, the Indus"tries Assistance Commission (IAC), will hold a 12-month inquiry into the Australian wheat industry, Primary Industry Minister John Kerin said.     The IAC has been asked to report on the need for assistance to the industry and the nature, duration and extent of any aid, he said in a statement.     He said the inquiry will be the first step in setting marketing arrangements to apply after June 30, 1989, when the underwriting and pricing provisions of the 1984 Wheat Marketing Act expire.     Kerin said the broad-ranging reference would allow a full examination of all aspects of the wheat-marketing system.     "The inquiry will be required to take into account changes which have taken place in the industry as a result of the agricultural policies of major wheat producing countries and the industry\\\'s capacity to adjust to any recommended changes," he said.     "The inquiry is at an important time for the wheat industry, as the substantial fall in world prices is likely to trigger underwriting support from the government for the first time," he said.     "Kerin was referring to the government\'s underwriting of the guarant"eed minimum price paid to wheatgrowers by the Australian Wheat Boar"d near the start of the season.     The IAC\'s report will be due at" the same time as the findings of the current Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport, Kerin said.     He said the timing of the IAC inquiry would allow its findings and those of the Royal Commission to be considered in later negotiations on wheat-marketing arrangements between the federal and state governments and the industry.

S'The failure of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) to reach agreement on coffee export quotas could trigger a massive selloff in London coffee futures of at least 100 stg per tonne today, coffee trade sources said.     Prices could easily drop to as low as 1.00 dlr or even 80 cents a lb this year from around 1.25 dlrs now, they said.     A special meeting between importing and exporting countries ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks over how to set the quotas. No further meeting to discuss quotas was set, delegates said.     Quotas, the major device used to stabilize prices under the International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago after prices soared following a damaging drought in Brazil.     With no propects for quotas in sight, heavy producer selling initially and a price war among commercial coffee roasting companies will ensue, the trade sources predicted.     Lower prices are sure to trickle down to the supermarket shelf this spring, coffee dealers said.     The U.S. And Brazil, the largest coffee importer and exporter respectively, each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown of the talks.     Jon Rosenbaum, U.S. Assistant trade representative and delegate to the talks, said in a statement after the council adjourned, "A majority of producers, led by Brazil, were not prepared to negotiate a new distribution based on objective criteria.     "We want to insure that countries receive export quotas based on their ability to supply the market, instead of their political influence in the ICO."     Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) President Jorio Dauster countered, "Negotiations failed because consumers tried to dictate quotas, not negotiate them."     Previously, quotas were determined by historical amounts exported, which gave Brazil a 30 pct share of a global market of about 58 mln 60-kilo bags. A majority of producers wanted quotas to continue under this basic scheme.     But most consumers and a maverick group of eight producers proposed carving up the export market on the basis of ex"portable production and stocks, which would reduce Brazil\'s share t"o 28.8 pct.     Consumer delegates said this method would reflect c"hanges in many countries\' export capabilities and make coffee more "readily available to consumers when they need it.     A last-minute attempt by Colombia, the second largest exporter, to rescue the talks with a compromise interim proposal could not bring the two side"s together.     Delegates speculated Brazil\'s financial problems, "illustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments on bank debt, have increased political pressure on the country to protect its coffee export earnings.     Developing coffee-producing countries that depend heavily on coffee earnings, particularly some African "nations and Colombia, are likely to be hurt the most by the ICO\'s f"ailure to agree quotas, analysts said.     The expected drop in prices could result in losses of as much as three billion dlrs in a year, producer delegates forecast.     The ICO executive board will meet March 31, but the full council is not due to meet again until September, delegates said.  REUTER \\x03'

S'European Community (EC) farm ministers early today abandoned talks aimed at saving an agreement on cutting excessive milk production after making no progress in over 12 hours of negotiations.     The ministers will resume talks at 10.00 local time in a bid to clear the way for a full-scale review of proposed reforms for other surplus sectors.     Diplomats said member states were unable to settle "differences over new rules limiting farmers\' automatic right to sel"l unwanted butter at high guaranteed prices into EC cold stores. West Germany and Ireland are opposed to the steps.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Earthquakes and aftershocks are still shaking areas of northern New" Zealand following yesterday\'s strong tremor which left 3,000 peopl"e homeless.     Four earthquakes measuring up to 4.5 on the Richter scale have hit the Bay of Plenty and Waikato region in the north-east since midnight yesterday (1200 GMT).     No casualties have been reported and no further major damage, civil defence sources said. Twenty-five people were treated for bone fractures after yesterda"y\'s shock.     A government seismologist said from Rotorua in the N"orth Island some five tremors were being recorded every 10 minutes."     Today\'s quakes were felt over an area of 100 square km, the s"eismologist added.     A state of civil defence emergency in the area was declared yesterday and is still in force, with schools closed and access to the worst-hit towns of Edgecumbe, Whakatane and the" forestry town of Kawerau severely restricted.     Yesterday\'s qua"ke measured 6.25 on the Richter scale.     The seismologist said if the pattern of other large earthquakes was followed the shocks would continue for one to several weeks, declining in frequency and magnitude. But the chance of a further large shock could not be ruled out.     Civil defence officials said major roadslips and landslides in the area are being cleared, with power and water restored to most areas. Rail lines twisted by earth movements are being repaired.     Prime Minister David Lange visited the region today before flying to Auckland to attend a South Pacific Forum conference of foreign ministers.     A small force of troops was moved into the area to assist civil defence workers and volunteers. Civil defence sources said people would shortly begin to return to their homes when the buildings are declared safe.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Equity investment company <Battery Group Ltd> said it had agreed to buy <Occidental Life Insurance Co of Australia Ltd> from TransAmerica Corp <TA> of the U.S. For 105 mln Australian dlrs.     The acquisition has been made possible by the efforts of its major shareholder, <Pratt and Co Financial Services Pty Ltd>, Battery Group said in a statement.     The purchase will be partly funded by the issue of eight mln shares at 4.50 dlrs each and four mln free options to the Pratt Group, controlled by entrepreneur Dick Pratt, plus four mln shares to professional investors at 4.50 each, it said.     The balance will be funded by debt, Battery Group said.     The acquisition is subject to the approval of its shareholders.     On completion of the share placements, Pratt Group will effectively have "51 pct of Battery\'s enlarged capital, assuming exercise of all opti"ons, it said. Battery now has 22 mln shares on issue.     Battery said Occidental Life is a major underwriter of individual term life insurance and a recent but fast-growing entrant in the individual account superannuation market.

S'Japanese investor interest in British gilt-edged securities is growing rapidly due to expectations sterling will remain stable despite the drop in oil prices, and on calculations gilt prices will firm, bond managers said.     Japanese, British and U.S. Securities houses have been expanding inventories of gilts to meet demand from investors seeking capital gains, including city and trust banks, which have been active on the U.S. Treasury market, they said.     Dealing demand for gilts with coupons around 10 pct has been getting stronger, the general manager of the local office of a British securities firm said.     On the other hand, major long-term investors such as Japanese insurance companies are not very enthusiastic about buying British securities ahead of the March 31 close of the Japanese financial year, traders said.     These investors, who must convert yen into sterling through dollars for British securities purchases, appear to be buying in London rather than in Tokyo, a bond manager for a British securities house said.     The sterling/yen rate was about 240.34/44 today, up from 234.50 at the start of the calendar year and a narrow range of 230 to 234 late last year.     Many bond traders in Tokyo are doubtful that sterling will further appreciate steeply. However, gilts may benefit from further declines in U.K. Interest rates, they said.     "The U.K. Government is in no hurry to issue more bonds, suggesting further market improvement and continuing demand from brokers here," said Laurie Milbank and Co assistant manager Machiko Suzuki.     She said she expected the yield on the actively traded 11-3/4 pct gilt due March 2007 to dip "below 9.5 pct, against 9.581 pct at yesterday\'s close in London.  "REUTER \\x03'

S'"Japan\'s unemployment rate is expected to continue to climb to about"" 3.5 pct within the next year from January\'s three pct record, seni"or economists, including Susumu Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japa"n, said.     December\'s 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since ""the government\'s Management and Coordination Agency began compiling" statistics under its current system in 1953.     "There is a general fear that we will become a country with high unemployment," said Takashi Kiuchi, senior economist for the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.     The government, which published the January unemployment figures today, did not make any predictions.     "At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment rate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situation improving," a Labour Ministry official said.     Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000 people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April.     Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget which has been hel"d up by opposition to proposed tax reforms.     The yen\'s surge has" caused layoffs in the mainstay steel and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries, such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employees and ceased hiring, economists said.     Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down, said Koichi" Tsukihara, Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank Ltd\'s economics" department.     However, other economists disagreed, saying the service sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the manufacturing sector over the next five years.     The economists said the service sector should grow as the government stimulates domestic demand under its program to transform the economy away from exports.     Although Japanese unemployment rates appear lower than those of other industrialised nations, methods for calculating statistics make them difficult to compare, economists warned.     "The three pct figure  could translate into a relatively high figure if European methods were used," one economist said. More than half of "January\'s 170,000 increase in jobless from a year earlier were thos""e aged between 15 and 24, Sumitomo\'s Tsukihara said.  REUTER \\x03"'

S'Central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng rejected a request by textile makers to halt the rise of the Taiwan dollar against the U.S. Dollar to stop them losing orders to South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore, a spokesman for the Taiwan Textile Federation said.     He quoted Chang as telling representatives of 19 textile associations last Saturday the government could not fix the Taiwan dollar exchange rate at 35 to one U.S. Dollar due to U.S. Pressure for an appreciation of the local currency.     The Federation asked the government on February 19 to hold the exchange rate at that level.     The federation said in its request that many local textile exporters were operating without profit and would go out of business if the rate continued to fall.     It said the Taiwan dollar has risen almost 14 pct against the U.S. Dollar since September 1985 while the South Korean won climbed only four pct. The Singapore and Hong Kong dollars remained stable against the U.S. Unit in that period, it said. "    Many local bankers and economists predict Taiwan\'s dollar will "rise to between 32 and 33 per U.S. Dollar by year-end.     Chang wa"s quoted as saying this would depend on Taiwan\'s ability to reduce "its trade surplus with the U.S. This year.     The surplus widened to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in calendar 1986 from 10.2 billi"on in 1985, official figures show.     Taiwan\'s textile exports fel"l by almost four pct in January to 562 mln U.S. Dlrs from 583 mln i"n January 1986, the same figures show.     Textiles are Taiwan\'s s"econd-largest export earner, after electrical and electronic products.     Textile exports surged to 7.8 billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 6.2 billion in 1985. Exports to the U.S. Last year were worth 2.8 billion U.S. Dlrs.  REUTER \\x03'

It appeared the government had agreed to demands by the five -- two officers and three privates -- for political asylum but there was no immediate announcement.     Official sources said Egyptian servicemen flew the Libyans north from Abu Simbel in their C-130 transport plane. The status of the sixth Libyan on board, the pilot, was not immediately known.

S'The U.S. Wants Japan to eliminate import controls on agricultural products within three years, visiting U.S. Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen Wallis told Eishiro Saito, Chairman of the Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren), a spokesman for Keidanren said.     The spokesman quoted Wallis as saying drastic measures would be needed to stave off protectionist legislation by Congress.     Wallis, who is attending a sub-cabinet-level bilateral trade meeting, made the remark yesterday in talks with Saito.     Wallis was quoted as saying the Reagan Administration wants Japanese cooperation so the White House can ensure any U.S. Trade bill is a moderate one, rather than containing retaliatory measures or antagonising any particular country.     He was also quoted as saying the U.S. Would be pleased were Japan to halve restrictions on agricultural imports within five years if the country cannot cope with abolition within three, the spokesman said.     Japan currently restricts imports of 22 agricultural products. A ban on rice import"s triggered recent U.S. Complaints about Japan\'s agricultural polic"y.  REUTER \\x03'

S'The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) acted to tighten restrictions on microchip exports to countries other than the U.S. To preserve a U.S.-Japan pact on semiconductor trade, but major Japanese chipmakers doubt its usefulness.     A MITI spokesman said his ministry had asked chipmakers to issue certificates to specified trading houses stating they are authorised exporters.     Trading houses applying for a MITI export licence will be required to show such a certificate, but those without it will not automatically be denied licences, he said.     But some industry officials predicted any government measures were likely to have limited effect as long as the world semiconductor market remained weak.     U.S. Government and industry officials have complained repeatedly that Japanese chipmakers continue to sell at below cost to third countries despite the July agreement.     Japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow of cheap chips to third countries is due to grey-market sales by third-party brokers, who seek to profit from the gap between low prices in Japan and higher prices based on production costs and set for Japanese makers under the agreement.     The MITI spokesman said, "If the percentage of grey market is increasing for one specific company, it suggests they are distributing their products through their sales network knowing they will be exported by some means. In that case we will ask them what they are doing to reduce the figure."     MITI earlier asked makers to cut output of certain chips by 10 pct in first-quarter 1987, spokesmen for the firms said.     But they doubt the usefulness of the latest move. "As long as there is a gap between prices set under the pact and market prices, there will be people who want to exploit the gap to make money," a Hitachi Ltd <HIT.T> spokesman said.  REUTER \\x03'

Nimit Nonthap"anthawat, chief economist at the <Bangkok Bank Ltd>, said Thailand\'"s strong export performance, its relatively high interest rates, foreign participation in its stock market, and growing foreign investment, especially from Japan, contributed to the projected sharp rise.     Thai exports rose 19.4 pct in 1986 and are expected to expand another 15 pct this year, bankers said.     A U.S. Embassy report said last month Thailand could achieve five pct real gross domestic product growth in 1987, up from a projection of 3.8 pct for 1986 and 3.7 pct in 1985.     Nonthapanthawat said if economic growth continues at its current pace and oil prices and major currencies remain stable the five billion 1987 reserves target can easily be reached.     Thailand calculates foreign reserves to include gold, special drawing rights and convertible currencies. The target is equi"valent to five-and-a-half months\' worth of imports.  REUTER \\x03"'

S'"Singapore\'s Finance Minister Richard Hu is expected to announce a n"eutral budget tomorrow with no major tax changes for the 1987/88 year starting April 1, bankers and economists told Reuters.     They said with real growth at an estimated 1.9 pct in calendar 1986, indicating signs of recovery from the 1.7 pct shrinkage in 1985, the government was likely to hold its course and wait for measures intr"oduced in last year\'s budget to work.     Last March Hu cut corpora"tion tax to 33 pct from 40 pct, and income tax was reduced by the same margin.     Last year the government also reduced wage costs by introducing a wage freeze and cutting employer contributions to the mandatory state savings scheme, the Central Provident Fund (CPF), to 15 pct of salaries from 25 pct.     "I don\\\'t foresee any new or additional stimulus because the economy is now improving," said Clemente Escano, vice president of the Union Bank of Switzerland. "    The government\'s economic report for calendar 1986, issued last" week, said the CPF reduction and other cost-cutting measures only started to bite in the third quarter of 1986.     But the report said over half the economy -- especially the commerce, financial, and business services sectors -- continued to be depressed by weakness in the surrounding regional economies and an excess of domestic property.     The sources said the fragility of the economic recovery suggested the government would not introduce much of its planned "consumption tax in the coming financial year.     In last year\'s bu"dget Hu said he planned to set up collecting machinery for the tax. Economists said a campaign against smoking this year might be the opportunity for him to levy the tax on tobacco as a first step towards its wider use.     The sources said the government does not loo"k likely to raise more revenue in this year\'s budget.     Last yea""r\'s budget projected a 3.22 billion dlr budget deficit for fiscal 1"986/87, but the economic report projected an overall calendar 1986 surplus of three billion.     Lower tax revenue was balanced by rising investment income and stringent controls on government operating expenditure, helped by the wage-freeze policy.     Anthony K.P. Lee, vice-president and deputy general manager of American Express "Bank Ltd, said he expected nothing exciting from this year\'s budget".     Lee said, "It will probably be a non-event as most of the tax benefits were given last year. The economy has already started moving so it does not need government support."     Last week\\\'s economic report attributed the one pct decline in domestic demand last year mainly to a sharp decline in private construction, so this sector hopes for some relief from the budget, economists said.     Th"e economic report said the sector\'s activity declined by 25.3 pct i"n calendar 1986 after a 13.9 pct contraction in 1985. A further dec"line is expected in 1987.     But in last year\'s budget a 30 pct re"bate on tax for industrial and commercial properties was raised to 50 pct until the end of 1988, so the most Hu is likely to do is add incentives for creating property investment unit trusts.     The "only measures known to be in tomorrow\'s budget are incentives to en"courage population growth, including incentives to families who have three children.     Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has already announced the government will try to encourage three-child families, instead of the two-child families it encourages now.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Fisons Plc <FISN.L> said strong international growth had been the m"ain feature of the group\'s 1986 progress, with the pharmaceutical d"ivision reporting a 50 pct increase in U.S. Sales during the period.     The rise was due to a sustained marketing programme, a larger sales force and the introduction of an aerosol form of its Intal anti-asthma drug, which pushed U.S. Sales up 70 pct.     The company was commenting on 1986 results which saw pre-tax profits rising to 85.1 mln stg from 72.3 mln in 1985. The result was in line with market forecasts, but its shares nevertheless eased in a falling market to 634p at 0857 GMT from 643p.     Fisons said the potential for future growth of Intral, as well as its Opticrom and Nasalcrom products, was clearly indicated by a strong 1986 performance.     The scientific equipment business had raised the proportion of high technology products it manufactures and also raised its ability to generate higher margins. The horticulture operations had demonstrated outstanding marketing ability. Underlying cash flow from all three operations had been positive despite a full programme of capital investment.     Action to protect the group against foreign currency movements resulted in a small net gain to profits.  REUTER \\x03'

S'The Philippines must devalue the peso if it wants its exports to remain competitive, Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod told Reuters.     "The peso/dollar rate has to be undercut to make our exports more competitive," Monsod said an interview. "No question abou"t it. I\'m saying you cannot argue with success. Taiwan, South Kore"a, West Germany, Japan, all those miracle economies deliberately undervalued their currencies."     The peso has been free-floating since June 1984. It is currently at about 20.50 to the U.S. Dollar.     Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said the government does not intend to devalue the peso and wants it to be flexible and able to continue to respond to market conditions.     Monsod said Ongpin was looking at the exchange rate from the point of view of finance. "If the dollar rate goes higher, our debt service in terms of pesos gets higher, so the financing is very difficult," she said. "But I am looking at it in terms of the economy."     She said she was not trying to oppose official policy.     "I\\\'m just saying, keep it competitive. I do not want it to become uncompetitive because then we are dead."     Monsod said, "The ideal movement in the peso/dollar rate is a movement that will reflect differences in inflation ("rates) of the Philippines versus the other country. It\'s an arithme"tic thing."     Official figures show Philippine inflation averaged 0.8 pct in calendar 1986. Ongpin told reporters on Saturday it was expected to touch five pct this year.     He said the government and the International Monetary Fund had set the peso/dollar 1987 target rate at 20.80.     The peso lost 22.2 pct in value to slump to 18.002 to the dollar when it was floated in 1984.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Zaire agreed to limit its tin exports to 1,736 tonnes for 12 months from March 1 in line with an Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) plan to curb exports, the ATPC said.     ATPC Executive Director Victor Siaahan told Reuters he received a telex from Zaire indicating its willingess to take part in the plan to limit total ATPC exports to 96,000 tonnes for a year from March 1.     Siaahan said Zaire is expected to produce 1,900 tonnes of tin in calendar 1987, and that in 1986 its output and exports were about 1,200 tonnes.     The ATPC hopes to cut the 70,000-tonne world surplus by 20,000 tonnes and boost prices.     All ATPC members except Zaire and Australia recently agreed to adhere to the export quotas allocated them under the plan. Australia said its quota of 7,000 tonnes was roughly equal to its expected output this year.     The ATPC consists of Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Bolivia, Australia, Nigeria and Zaire.     China and Bolivia, important producers of tin, are not members.  REUTER \\x03'

S'"Japan\'s major commercial banks plan to set up a joint company to wh"ich they will transfer assets acquired by lending to developing countries to build up a reserve against possible bad loans, a senior official of a major bank told Reuters.     He said about 10 banks are likely to finish details of the project in a few weeks. The intent is to avoid risk arising from unrecoverable debt owed by Third World countries, he said.  REUTER \\x03'

S'"The Federation of Bankers\' Associations of Japan released its propo"sal for early creation of a comprehensive financial futures market in Tokyo.     The market should include a comprehensive range of futures and options trading so Tokyo can develop into a real global money centre where a variety of risk-hedging instruments is available, the proposal said.     It should provide currency and interest rate futures, and incorporate the existing yen bond futures and planned stock index futures contracts.     The proposal said transactions in all these contracts must be conducted on the same market so participants can readily engage in arbitrage between various financial instruments.     To make this possible, the proposal calls for new legislation which would administer all related futures and options transactions under the same legal framework.     Banking sources said they expect that initially the currency futures would be dollar-yen and interest futures would include Japanese domestic yen certificates of deposit, three-month Eurodollar deposits and 20-year U.S. Treasury bonds.     Banking sources quoted federation chairman Yoshiro Araki as saying he hoped the market would be created as soon as possible because it would help promote the liberalisation "of Japan\'s financial markets.     Araki said he had no intention o"f limiting prospective market participants to banks but was willing to accept those from wider business circles, the sources said.   "  Japan\'s only current financial futures market, in yen bonds, bega"n on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in October 1985.     But the Osaka Stock Exchange plans to start futures trading in a basket of leading stocks in April.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Australian police said they charged a former currency clerk of Westpac Banking Corp <WSTP.S> with misappropriating 8,300 dlrs in July in an alleged foreign-exchange fraud.     A spokeswoman for the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) said the arrest was part of its investigation stemming from complaints from Westpac and <Kleinwort Benson Australia Ltd>.     CAC and Westpac officials said they were working out how much money was involved, but said press reports it was as much as five mln dlrs were probably exaggerated.     Police told reporters it was alleged the former clerk quoted an incorrect dealing price relationship between the yen and the Swiss franc.     They said the CAC was investigating 14 other cases involving 214,000 dlrs.     A Kleinwort Benson spokesman declined to comment on the case but the company said in a statement yesterday a small loss incurred in 1986 in its foreign-exchange division was unrelated to "certain alleged forex irregularities."

Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of trea"sury bills will drain some 525 mln stg while bankers\' balnces below" target will take out around 175 mln stg.     Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions and a fall in note circulation will add some 300 mln stg and 40 mln stg to the system respectively.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Japan looks likely to allow U.S. Banks to conduct securities business here, a move that will probably cause the barriers separating Japanese commercial banks from brokerage houses to break down, financial analysts said.     But the timing of the approval remains uncertain, due to conflicting domestic interests.     J.P.Morgan and Co <JPM>, Bankers Trust New York Corp <BT>, Manufacturers Hanover Corp <MHC> and Chemical Bank New York Corp <CHL> are expected to win approval to conduct securities business in Japan, U.S. Bank officials said.     "There is no reason for extended delay of approval," one official at a U.S. Bank said. The four U.S. Banks have been seeking finance ministry approval for months.     To date, Japan has allowed European banks to do securities business here through 50-pct owned subsidiaries. As Japanese banks can conduct securities business in European countries, this was seen as a reciprocal move and did not pave the way for Japanese banks to enter the domestic securities market.     But if U.S. Banks win approval, Japanese banks will press hard for similiar status, since they are not allowed to conduct securities business in the U.S.     Many U.S. Bank officials expect their applications to be approved before June. But Japanese banking sources said the decision will be delayed until next year. A spokesman for the finance ministry declined comment.     U.S. Bankers will meet with ministry officials for talks on financial market deregulation sometime in the next few months. Ministry sources said the talks are likely to be held in April or June.     At the last round of financial negotiations in September, U.S. Officials sai"d Japan\'s commitment to deregulation was flagging.     Analysts sa"id the finance ministry has been seriously considering the U.S. Request since the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of New York approved five new primary government securities dealers, including two Japanese brokerages, last December.     They said the ministry will have to approve the U.S. Request soon to head off criticism its markets are not as open to foreigners as those of the U.S.     Analysts said Japan has proceeded rapidly with financial deregulation since 1984, but has not touched upon the clear division between the securities and banking businesses.     Japanese banks and securities houses have fought hard to protect their interests, but analysts said the banks are finding it increasingly difficult to earn money in traditional fields.     Officials of major Japanese banks said they will "pay special attention to the ministry\'s reaction to U.S. Bank requ"ests because approval would accelerate market liberalization in Japan.     The Japanese bankers hope approval will pave the way for their own entry into the domestic securities market.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Saudi riyal interbank deposit rates eased across the board in a dull market which was long in day-to-day funds, dealers said.     Tod"ay\'s quiet market continued a lull of several days in which traders" were said to be waiting on the sidelines ahead of further clues to the direction of oil prices and the Saudi economy.     Dealers cited some borrowing interest in two, three, and six-month deposits but said activity focused on short dates and one-month deposits as banks tried to lend surplus funds.     Spot-next was put at 5-3/4, 5-1/4 pct, down from six, 5-1/2 yesterday while one-week rates were steady at six, 5-1/2 pct.     One-month deposits declined to 6-1/4, 1/8 pct from 6-1/2, 1/4 on Monday, while three months was barely changed at seven, 6-15/16 pct.     The spot riyal was little changed at 3.7501/03 to the dollar after quotes of 3.7498/7501 yesterday.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Early dollar straight eurobond trade was quiet with currency sectors, particularly eurosterling, continuing to perform strongly, closely reflecting current trading patterns on the foreign exchanges, dealers said.     Eurosterling bonds continued to rise steadily, bolstered by the extremely ebullient tone of the U.K. Government bond market on a combination of positive U.K. Economic fundamentals.     The dollar was initially stabler but most dollar straight bonds were static in dull trade. A handful of issues showed signs of weakne"ss but dealers said investors were awaiting today\'s release of U.S." Leading indicators for January.     The U.S. Data due out this afternoon is expected to be weak, placing the U.S. Unit under renewed pressure and robbing the market in dollar-denominated eurobonds of fresh trading impetus, one dollar straight trader said.     "It\\\'s" going to be another tedious day and I can\'t see how anybody is goi"ng to make any money," he said.     Eurosterling issues continued to rally on the back of general sterling euphoria -- with the U.K. Currency trading at six month highs on interest rate optimism and the strength of the domestic equity markets.     Eurosterling bonds saw early gains of up to half a point.     However, some eurosterling dealers noted the bonds could soon fall back marginally if -- as expected -- professionals stepped in to take profits at current healthy levels.     Trade in mark-denominated bonds was expected to be subdued today due to pre-Lenten carnival festivities in West Germany.     There were signs of reawakened investor nerves affecting trade in the floating rate note market which yesterday started the week extremely quietly after a hectic sell-off last week.     FRN dealers said paper of U.S. -- and also of Canadian -- banks was seeing some pressure as a result of recent press reports focussing on their exposure to Latin American debt.     "(Brazilian Finance Minis"ter Dilson) Funaro\'s visit to Europe has also brought the spotlight" back onto the debt crisis after things had more or less quietened down following the first shock statements last week," one FRN specialist said.     Despite the dearth of activity in the dollar straight secondary market, two new dollar issues were the only early features on the primary market.     These were a five year 150 mln dlr deal launched by Morgan Guaranty Ltd for Saab Scania at 7-3/4 pct priced at 101-3/4 pct.     The other issue was a 100 mln dlr deal -- also due 1992 -- for NV Nederlandse Gasunie paying 7-1/4 pct and priced at 101-1/8 pct, with Citicorp Investment Bank Ltd as lead manager.     Dealers predicted reasonable demand for both issues due mainly to a lack of fresh, good name paper in the market.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Mexican state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) signed for a 500 mln dlr\\x7funtied loan from the Export-Import Bank of Japan to finance its Pacific Petroleum Project, Pemex Japan representative Tito Ayal said.     No further details on the loan were immediately available.     Ayala told an oil seminar the project, due for completion in 1988, is aimed at improving distribution of oil products in the domestic market, mainly along the Pacific coast.     The project consists of a pipeline linking Nueva Teapa on the Gulf of Mexico with Salina Cruz on the Pacific Coast, and construction of the second phase of the Salina Cruz refinery.     The project also includes construction of liquified petroleum gas (LPG) storage tanks at Santa Cruz, additional crude oil storage at both ends of the pipeline, an ammonia complex at Lazaro Cardenas on the Pacific Coast and expansion of the infrastructure of the port of Salina Cruz, Ayala said.     Pemex will buy 80 mln dlrs worth of foreign equipment and materials for the project, he said. The new pipeline will enable Japa"n to load Mexico\'s Maya crude oil at Salina Cruz rather than in the" Gulf of Mexico. Pemex will also have some LPG surplus available in Salina Cruz that may help Japan diversify its supply sources of that product, he added.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Comalco Ltd <CMAC.S> said its return to profit reflected reduced costs, improved primary aluminium prices and its withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture.     It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for the year ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was also aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt and greater sales of bauxite and aluminium.     Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents per share final, dividend delayed until July 1 to take advantage of proposed dividend imputation laws.     This would make five cents for the year against a first and final of one cent in 1985.     Comalco said the aluminium industry continued to suffer from low prices and excess capacity, though the weak Australian dollar had helped earnings.     Withdrawal from the <Showa Aluminium Industries KK> joint venture had been recapitalised in expansion by the <New Zealand Aluminium Smelters Ltd>" project with Japan\'s <Sumitomo Aluminium Smelting Co Ltd>, permitt"ing repayments and increases in liquid funds totalling 165 mln dlrs", it said.     As previously reported Comalco\'s <Commonwealth Alumi"nium Corp> unit has conditionally agreed to sell its smelter at Goldendale, Washington, and port facilities at Portland, Oregon to <Columbia Aluminium Corp>.     Comalco said it had made a 27.3 mln dlr extraordinary provision for Goldendale losses and closure costs but that if the sales agreement were completed it would reduce the provision made in the 1986 accounts.     The other items in the total extraordinary loss of 140.5 mln dlrs were a 102.9 mln write-off of unrealised exchange losses and 10.3 mln for an increase in future tax provision.  REUTER \\x03'

S'CRA Ltd <CRAA.S> said it expected to pay a final 1986 dividend of not less than 10 cents a share after July 1, making 13 cents for\\x7fthe year against 15 in 1985.     The mining and smelting group earlier reported 1986 net earnings rose to 138.2 mln dlrs from 87.8 mln" in 1985, against analysts\' forecasts yesterday of 125 mln to\\x7f16"0 mln.     CRA said it was deferring consideration of a dividend until later this year to provide the benefit of dividend imputation to its shareholders. After July 1, dividends will be tax-free to shareholders provided they come out of earnings on which the full 49 pct company tax rate has been p\\x7fid.     The company operates on a substituted tax year, not the fiscal year ending June 30, and as a result has incurred tax at the 49 pct rate on 1986 earnings, CRA said in a statement.     Consequently, it has funds available for distribution with dividend imputed but is waiting to see the imputation legislation before determining the final payout, it said.     Despite the higher net earnings, CRA said 1986 was a poor year for the minerals industry, with the notable exception of gold producers.     Prices for major metals expressed in real U.S. Dollars declined to the lowest levels in about 50 years, it said.     Fluctuating exchange and interest rates added volatility and uncertainty, while the revaluation of the yen is leading to substantial restructuring of Japanese industry, CRA said.     World demand for metals is growing slowly. Inventories have steadily declined, with supply and demand in better balance, but overcapacity continues, CRA said.     Turning to contributions to its earnings, CRA said Bougainville Copper Ltd <BUVA.S> contributed 31.3 mln dlrs while its share of Com"alco Ltd\'s <CMAC.S> net was 37.8 mln.     Net earnings from iron-or"e operations were 111.8 mln dlrs against 149.2 mln in 1985, it said.     Lead, zinc and silver mining and smelting operations incurred a net loss of 66.8 mln dlrs against a 38.1 mln loss in 1985, CRA said.     Coal activities resulted in a net profit of 36.7 mln dlrs against 34.1 mln, while salt raised its contribution to 4.7 mln f"rom 2.8 mln.     CRA\'s share of earnings from the Argyle diamond pr"oject amounted to 12.0 mln dlrs against nine mln in 1985.     CRA said the main item in its 250.28 mln dlr extraordinary loss was a 172.9 mln writeoff of unrealised foreign exchange losses on borrowings as required by a new accounting standard.     Other extraordinary items were 63.3 mln dlrs provided for closures and writedown of assets and a 14.1 mln increase in future tax provisions, CRA said.     Cash flow continued at a high level, being 950.6 mln dlrs before capital expenditure against 1.02 billion in 1985. The strong cash flow, coupled with the proceeds of the 1986 rights issue and the use of existing cash balances, enabled group debt to be reduced by nearly 500 mln dlrs.     CRA said it held forward contracts at year-end to buy 985 mln U.S. Dlrs to hedge part of its foreign debt. This cost 47.0 mln dlrs after tax, included in the net interest cost.  REUTER \\x03'

S'China called on the United States to remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology.     But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing 13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade Congress to change laws which limit its exports.      The offi"cial International Business newspaper today published China\'s deman"ds in a  editorial to coincide with the visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.      "It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its restrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilities for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese exports," the editorial said.      "The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).      "Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries," it added      Th"e paper also printed an article by China\'s commercial counsellor in" its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who said that "all kinds of difficulties and restrictions" were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential.      He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs on technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation.      The paper also printed a table showing that, since bilateral trade began in 1972, China has had a deficit every year except 1972 and 1977. It shows the 1986 and 1985 deficits at 2.09 billion and 1.722 billion dlrs.      A U.S. Embassy official said the "U.S. Did not accept Peking\'s trade figures at all, mainly because t"hey exclude goods shipped to Hong Kong and then trans-shipped to U.S. While U.S. Figures are based on country of origin.      He said that, if China wants to obtain GSP status, it will have to lobby Congress itself to persaude it to amend several laws which currently prevent Peking getting such status.      The U.S. Trade Act of 1974 says that to qualify for GSP, China must be a member of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT), for which it applied in July 1986, and "not be dominated or controlled by international Communism."      The official said China was well aware of the laws, so"me of which date to the anti-Communist early 1950\'s, but that ther"e is not sufficient political will in the U.S. To change them.      China has been the subject of about a dozen cases involving anti-dumping in the U.S. Within the last two years, which the U.S. Side won, he said.      But, for the first time, China signed last week an agreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain exports of at least two categories of steel goods, which may lead the U.S. Side to withdraw the anti-dumping case, he added.      Another diplomat said willingness to provide such voluntary export restraints would be an important issue in bilateral trade issues and in Peking\\\'s application to GATT.      "China has the potential to disrupt world markets, especially in textiles. Other GATT countries will be nervous about China in this respect. But there is a precedent for other centralled planned economies in GATT," the diplomat said.      Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania are members of GAT"T but none has China\'s massive market potential for imports or its "vast labour pool to produce cheap exports.      In a speech today in the northeast city of Dalian, U.S. Secretary of State George Shul"tz said his country welcomed China\'s interest in participating in G"ATT.      "The process of Chinese accession will not be accomplished overnight -- the GATT rules were not designed for a large economy of the Chinese type," Shultz said.      "China can play an important role by actively joining GATT discussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and enhance market access for exports worldwide. China can further develop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum benefit from its GATT participation," he said.      The problems facing U.S.-China trade and GATT membership are similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmen regard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs, especially for exports, and a de facto dual currency system.      In a memorandum backing its application presented to GATT last month, China said it was gradually reforming its economic system and replacing mandatory instruction with "guidance planning" and economic levers.      The diplomat said that, to join GATT, China had much to do.  REUTER \\x03'

S'The Bundesbank is unlikely to change its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on Thursday, as exchange rates and short-term interest rates have stabilized over the past few weeks, money market dealers said.     Attention in the money market is focused o"n tomorrow\'s tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which fu"nds will be credited on Thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining 16 billion marks from the system.     The tender was announced last Friday, because carnival festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday, and will close banks here this afternoon.     Because of the disruption to business from carnival, minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their needs at the tender.     Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough liquidity in this week"\'s pact to keep short-term rates down.     But because of uncertain""ty about banks\' current holdings, the Bundesbank may well allocate "less than 16 billion marks this week, and top it up if necessary at next week\\\'s tender.     "I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks," one dealer said.     "They would then stock it up at the next tender when the need is clearer," he added.     An earlier pact expires next week, draining 8.5 billion marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers.     Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at the Bundesbank, averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month, just clear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement.     Call money traded today at 3.85/95 pct, up from 3.80/90 yesterday.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Chase Manhattan Asia Ltd of Hong Kong has approached Taiwan banks to take part in a syndicated loan of 300 mln U.S. Dlrs to finance a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Indonesia, local banking sources said.     The project calls for construction of a 400 mln U.S. Dlr facility which could produce two mln tonnes of LNG for supply "by Taiwan\'s state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp .     This was the f"irst time Taiwanese banks, including the Bank of Taiwan and Bank of Communications, were invited to form a syndicated loan, they added.     Pertamina has initialled a 20-year contract with Chinese Petroleum Corp <CPC> for the supply of 1.5 mln tonnes of LNG for Taiwan starting October 1989, a CPC official said.     CPC is building an LNG receiving terminal in southern Taiwan city of Kaohsiung at a cost of 820 mln U.S. Dlrs. The terminal will be completed in mid-1989.     A Taiwanese banker said"It will be a good idea for our banks to take part in the loan if we want to start in the international lending market."  REUTER \\x03'

S'The European <Airbus Industrie> consortium has signed a one billion dlr contract to sell 10 A320 short-haul jets to <All Nippon Airways> of Japan, with an option on the sale of a further 10 planes, an Airbus spokesman said today.     The 10 planes on firm order will be delivered between September, 1990 and November, 1991, and will be powered either by CFM-56-5S engines made by the Franco-U.S. <CFM International> consortium, or V2500S engines built by the <International Aero Engine> group.     The spokesman declined to comment on a New York Times report that Airbus is about to announce a sale to American Airlines.     But industry sources said American was about to announce the purchase of 25 wide-bodied planes from Airbus, as well as 15 747s from Boeing Co <BAN>.     Airbus has already signed large deals with Pan Am Corp <PNN>, NWA Inc <NWA> and Eastern Airlines Inc <EALN>, as well as a smaller contract with <Continental Airlines>.     The A320 made its first flight on February 22 and is not due to enter commercial service until March next year.     The All Nippon purchase brings the total number of commitments to the A320 to 439 from 16 airlines, comprising 275 firm orders and 164 options.  REUTER \\x03'

S'"Britain\'s gold and currency reserves showed an underlying rise of 2"87 mln dlrs in February, after a 72 mln dlrs rise in January, the Treasury said.     The underlying trend, which is a guide to Bank of England operations to support the pound on foreign exchanges, is net of borrowings and repayments.     This was above market expectations for a 100 mln dlrs rise.     The Treasury said the Bank of England used the opportunity of strong demand to rebuild reserves after losses last autumn and said the underlying rise was still relatively modest.     Actual reserves rose by 305 mln dlrs in February to 22.26 billion dlrs, after rising 29 mln in January to 21.95 billion.     Accruals of borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were 36 mln dlrs last month, after 163 mln in January, while repayments were 16 mln dlrs after the previous 151 mln, a Treasury spokesman said.     Capital repayments totalled two mln dlrs. In January, capital repayments totalled 14 mln dlrs, with a valuation change that resulted in a fall of 41 mln dlrs due to the quarterly rollover from the European Monetary Cooperation Fund swap.     The Treasury "would not comment on the Bank of England\'s market operations, but c"urrency traders reported moderate Bank of England intervention to curb upward pressure on the pound today.     A Treasury spokesman, commenting on the reserves figures, said that the government does not want sterling either to rise too far or to fall substantially from current levels.     He noted that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson stressed this after the recent Paris currencies meeting.     REUTER \\x03'

S'Comalco Ltd said its return to profit reflected reduced costs, improved primary aluminium prices and its withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture.     It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for the year ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was also aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt and greater sales of bauxite and aluminium.     Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents per share final dividend, delayed until July 1 to take advantage of proposed dividend imputation laws.     This would make five cents for the year against a first and final of one cent in 1985.     Comalco said the aluminium industry continues to suffer from low prices and excess capacity, though the we"ak Australian dollar had helped earnings.     Comalco\'s Commonweal"th Aluminium Corp unit said earlier it has conditionally agreed to sell its Goldendale smelter in Washington, and port facilities at Portland, Oregon to Columbia Aluminium Corp. Comalco said its extraordinary provision of 27.3 mln dlrs costs for Goldendale losses and closure may be reduced if the sales agreement were completed.  REUTER \\x03'

S'The Bundesbank is unlikely to change its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on Thursday, as exchange rates and short-term interest rates have stabilized over the past few weeks, money market dealers said.     Attention in the money market is focused o"n tomorrow\'s tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which fu"nds will be credited on Thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining 16 billion marks from the system.     The tender was announced last Friday, because carnival festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday, and will close banks here this afternoon.     Because of the disruption to business from carnival, minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their needs at the tender.     Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough liquidity in this week"\'s pact to keep short-term rates down.     But because of uncertain""ty about banks\' current holdings, the Bundesbank may well allocate "less than 16 billion marks this week, and top it up if necessary at next week\\\'s tender.     "I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks," one dealer said.     "They would then stock it up at the next tender when the need is clearer," he added.     An earlier pact expires next week, draining 8.5 billion marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers.     Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at the Bundesbank, averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month, just clear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement.     Call money traded today at 3.85/95 pct, up from 3.80/90 yesterday.  REUTER \\x03'

S'West German banks would like Brazil to work more closely with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with a view to seeking a solution "to the country\'s debt problems, senior West German banking sources "said.     The sources, speaking ahead of a meeting later today between Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro and his West german counterpart Gerhard Stoltenberg, also believed Brazil should come up with a convincing economic recovery program.     Their comments echoed those of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, who met Funaro yesterday.     Funaro is currently on a European trip seeking to involve governments in negotiations with commercial banks" on rescheduling part of Brazil\'s foreign debt, which totals some "109 billion dlrs. But Lawson told Funaro Brazil had to solve its problems with the banks rather than governments.     Diplomatic sources in Bonn said Funaro would leave early tomorrow morning for Zurich after meeting Stoltenberg this evening.     Funaro has rejected suggestions for negotiations with the IMF and said there is no question of Brazil agreeing to an austerity program with the Fund.     However, the West German banking sources said institutions here felt it was particularly important that Brazil presented a credible recovery program and that there be a "rapprochement" with the IMF.     "Consultations are the least that can be expected," said one ba"nker.     Funaro\'s trip follows the decision by Brazil 10 days ago "to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt. It has also frozen bank and credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions worth about 15 billion dlrs.     One senior banker closely involved in Brazilian debt negotiation offered qualified support for a call from Funaro for a change in the structure of the advisory committee of banks which has coordinated Brazilian debt since 1982.     Funaro said yesterday that U.S. Banks, holding 35 pct of Brazilian debt, were over-represented on the 14-bank advisory committee with 50 pct of the committee seats. He said Brazil might adopt a different approach to its creditor banks, involving separate discussions with the regions.     Such a move would be in Braz"il\'s interest, since European banks have been more supportive than "U.S. Banks of alternative debt solutions, such as interest capitalisation.     The senior banker was strongly opposed to a purely regional approach, saying: "There must be one committee and one solution." But he added: "There must be an understanding that special requests from special regions be taken into account."     German banks had objected to the fact that the idea of interest capitalisation had been rejected in the committee. It was imperative that alternative options be considered. "The menu must become richer," the banker said.     Banking sources said commercial banks would not be invo"lved in today\'s talks with Funaro. A spokesman for the Bundesbank i"n Frankfurt said the central bank would also not be represented.     West German banks have taken a more relaxed attitude to the Brazilian suspension of interest payments than institutions in the United States, because of their lower exposure.     According to Bundesbank data from September last year, West German bank exposure to Latin America of slightly under 16 billion marks represented less than five pct of all foreign credit.

S'President Corazon Aquino announced government plans to devote to land reform an estimated 24 billion pesos (about one billion U.S. Dlrs) raised from the sale of failed businesses taken over by the gove"rnment.     Aquino said she was willing to have her family\'s sugar "estate broken up in compliance with Philippine land reform programmes but hinted it would not be offered voluntarily.     "Whatever laws will be enacted, I say that nobody is above the law and that includes me. My brothers and sisters are Filipino citizens ... We will abide by whatever laws are enacted as far as sugar land is concerned," she told reporters.     A committee was now formulating guidelines for the plan, including the question of whether land operated by multinational companies should also be covered, she added.     Agrarian Reform Secretary Heherson Alvarez said recently the government planned to distribute 9.7 mln hectares of land to impoverished farmworkers under a revised land reform programme.     The plan, requiring about 1.7 billion dlrs, now also covers sugar and coconut areas, apart from rice and corn lands, he said. It was expected to benefit about three mln landless peasants, he added.     Land ref"orm pressure groups have called on Aquino to break up her family\'s "6,000-hectare sugar estate to demonstrate her sincerity on the issue political analysts have called one of the most pressing problems facing the Philippines.     It was not known whether government would wait for the Congress to convene by mid-year to formalise the programme or have Aquino carry it out through an executive order.     Under the plan, government will purchase land mainly from landowners with holdings over seven hectares. It will include vacant and untenanted farmland as well as 50,000 hectares seized from former associates of deposed president Ferdinand Marcos.  REUTER \\x03'

S'Opec remains within its agreed output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels a day, and had expected current fluctuations in the spot market of one or two dlrs, Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said.     He told reporters after meeting with President Suharto that present weakness in the spot oil market was the result of warmer weather in the U.S. And Europe which reduced demand for oil.     Prices had also been forced down because refineries were using up old stock, he said.     He denied that Opec was exceeding its agreed production ceiling. Asked what Opec\\\'s output level was now, he replied: "Below 15.8 (mln barrels per day)." He did not elaborate.     He said there appeared to have been some attempts to manipulate the market, but" if all Opec members stick by the cartel\'s December pricing agreeme"nt it would get through present price difficulties.     He predicted that prices would recover again in the third and fourth quarters of 1987.     He also reiterated that there was no need for an emergency Opec meeting.     He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the spot price. "We hope the weak price will be overcome, and predict the price will be better in the third and fourth quarters."     Refiners, he said, appeared to have used up old stock deliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price to fall. But Opec would get through this period if members stuck together.

S'"Japan\'s unemployment rate is expected to continue to climb to about"" 3.5 pct within the next year from January\'s three pct record, seni"or economists, including Susumu Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japa"n, said.     December\'s 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since ""the government\'s Management and Coordination Agency began compiling" statistics under its current system in 1953.     "There is a general fear that we will become a country with high unemployment," said Takashi Kiuchi, senior economist for the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.     The government, which published the January unemployment figures today, did not make any predictions.     "At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment rate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situation improving," a Labour Ministry official said.     Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000 people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April.     Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget which has been hel"d up by opposition to proposed tax reforms.     The yen\'s surge has" caused layoffs in the mainstay steel and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries, such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employees and ceased hiring, economists said.     Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down, said Koichi" Tsukihara, Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank Ltd\'s economics" department.     However, other economists disagreed, saying the service sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the manufacturing sector over the next five years.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng rejected a request by textile makers to halt the rise of the Taiwan dollar against the U.S. Dollar to stop them losing orders to South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore, a spokesman for the Taiwan Textile Federation said.     He quoted Chang as telling representatives of 19 textile associations last Saturday the government could not fix the Taiwan dollar exchange rate at 35 to one U.S. Dollar due to U.S. Pressure for an appreciation of the local currency.     The Federation asked the government on February 19 to hold the exchange rate at that level.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Japanese investor interest in British gilt-edged securities is growing rapidly due to expectations sterling will remain stable despite the drop in oil prices, and on calculations gilt prices will firm, bond managers said.     Japanese, British and U.S. Securities houses have been expanding inventories of gilts to meet demand from investors seeking capital gains, including city and trust banks, which have been active on the U.S. Treasury market, they said.     Dealing demand for gilts with coupons around 10 pct has been getting stronger, the general manager of the local office of a British securities firm said.     On the other hand, major long-term investors such as Japanese insurance companies are not very enthusiastic about buying British securities ahead of the March 31 close of the Japanese financial year, traders said.     These investors, who must convert yen into sterling through dollars for British securities purchases, appear to be buying in London rather than in Tokyo, a bond manager for a British securities house said.     The sterling/yen rate was about 240.34/44 today, up from 234.50 at the start of the calendar year and a narrow range of 230 to 234 late last year.     Many bond traders in Tokyo are doubtful that sterling will further appreciate steeply. However, gilts may benefit from further declines in U.K. Interest rates, they said.     "The U.K. Government is in no hurry to issue more bonds, suggesting further market improvement and continuing demand from brokers here," said Laurie Milbank and Co assistant manager Machiko Suzuki.     She said she expected the yield on the actively traded 11-3/4 pct gilt due March 2007 to dip "below 9.5 pct, against 9.581 pct at yesterday\'s close in London.  "REUTER \\x03'

S'Daimler-Benz AG [DAIG.F] said its car production could fall by 150 cars a day in  the foreseeable future  if works councils continue t"o refuse to approve the firm\'s requests for employees to work overt"ime when necessary.     A company spokesman said the works council "at Daimler\'s Unterturkheim plant, which makes axles and other compo"nents for Daimler cars, has withheld approval for overtime since the beginning of the month. The IG Metall metalworkers union in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg has called on works councils in the state to reject overtime in a bid to get industry to employ more workers.     The Daimler spokesman said the lack of overtime work at the Unterturkheim plant could eventually affect car output at other plants but added he was unable to say when this might occur.     A spokesman for Dr.-Ing. H.C. F. Porsche AG [PSHG.F], which is also located in Baden-Wuerttemberg, said he did not think Porsche would suffer any loss of production because of a ban on overtime by its own works councils.     A strike by IG Metall in Baden-Wuerttemberg in 1984 closed down the German car industry for about seven weeks as the union sought to win a 35-hour working week for its members. It later settled for a reduction in the working week to 38.5 hours.  "   The spokesman said Daimler\'s total output of cars was currently "around 2,500 a day.  REUTER \\x03'

S'"The price of Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels Ltd <SHLH.HK>\'s stock soa"red on speculation of a takeover battle between major shareholders the Kadoorie family and the Evergo Industrial Enterprise Ltd <EVGH.HK> group, stock brokers said.     They noted heavy buying in Hk H"otel shares after an announcement by Evergo\'s <China Entertainment "and Land Investment Co Ltd> unit that it bought about 20 pct of Hk "Hotels from the firm\'s deputy chairman David Liang for 1.06 billion" dlrs. The stock rose 12 H.K. Dlrs to 62 dlrs today.     Thomas Lau", Evergo\'s executive director, declined comment on whether the grou"p is seeking a further stake in Hk Hotels. But he told Reuters the group will hold the 20 pct stake bought from Liang as long term investment.     He said Evergo "was attracted by the underlying strength of Hk Hotels."     Analysts said Evergo may be looking for a po"ssible redevelopment of the Peninsula Hotel, one of Asia\'s best kno"wn hotels, and another site on Hong Kong island. Both are owned by Hk Hotels.     <Lai Sun Garment Co ltd> yesterday said it acquired a 10 pct stake in Hk Hotels from Liang for 530 mln dlrs.     Lau denied any link between China Entertainment and Lai Sun on their acquisitions of the Hk Hotels stake.     "It is purely coincidence," he said.     But analysts were not so certain, saying that the Evergo group, which has a reputation as a corporate raider, may team up with Lai Sun Garment for a takeover.     Lau also denied any contact with the Kadoorie family, which analysts estimate has more than 20 pct of Hk Hotels. Michael Kadoorie is chairman of Hk Hotels.     Lau said two representatives of Evergo will be nominated to the Hk Hotels board.     A source close to the Kadoorie family said the family has not considered any countermoves so far.     Analysts said it would be difficult for Evergo and the Kadoorie family to cooperate because of different management styles.     "Evergo may want to split up the hotel management and property developments of Hk Hotels but that strategy may not fit the conservative Kadoorie family," said an analyst who asked not to be named.     Another analyst noted the price of Hk Hotels had been distorted by the takeover talks because its net asset value is only worth about 50 dlrs a share. The offers by Evergo and Lai Sun were for 53 dlrs a share, though that is well below the current trading price.     Trading was suspended today in shares of Lai Sun, Evergo, China Entertainment and "the group\'s associate <Chinese Estates Ltd>.     Chinese Estates l"ost 25 cents to 20.15 dlrs yesterday, China Entertainment five to 8.60 dlrs and Evergo one to 74 cents. Lai Sun gained 50 cents to 70.50 dlrs.  REUTER \\x03'

S'"Last week\'s White House shake-up has increased the odds that Federa"l Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker, a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the arms-to-Iran scandal, will serve a third term, sources close to the Fed say.     But they said that no decision on the appointment, which must be filled this August, has been taken by the White House and Volcker too has not made up his mind.     Former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan, who resigned last week when ex-senator Howard Baker was named as his replacement, was implacably opposed to Volcker and tried often to undermine him.     It is an open secret in Washington that Regan tried to ensure that Volcker, first appointed in 1979 by President Carter, will "not be offered a third term by President Reagan.     Only Volcker\'s" key allies in the Reagan administration, Vice-President George Bus"h and Treasury Secretary James Baker, kept Regan\'s recent maneuveri"ng at bay, the sources said.     Sources close to the administration say Regan leaked a story, quickly shot down by others in the administration, that Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the council of economic advisers, had been chosen to replace Volcker.     But as the adm"inistration\'s credibility was increasingly under fire, it became cl""ear that Regan\'s power to bring about such changes was on the wane."     The sources said New White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the Treasury Department and is likely to respect his views on the Fed chairmanship.     As a moderate Republican, Baker is also unlikely to share the right-wing\\\'s opposition to Volcker.     "This new White House is going to need all the strength it can get," said one source when aske"d about the possibility of Volcker\'s reappointment.     Paul Volck"er is deeply respected in financial markets both in the United States and around the world. At a time when the stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor nations are in question, Volcker"\'s departure would definitely undermine U.S. leadership, foreign ex"change analysts say.     U.S. officials say Volcker works very closely with Treasury Secretary Baker on issues like international debt and global economic cooperation.     The two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate the banking industry, but recent statements by Volcker, in which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation, signalled the politically-independent central bank is coming around at least partially to the Treasury position.     And a recent statement by a Reagan administration official that the two men saw "exactly eye-to-eye" on the dollar was seen as an indicati"on of Baker\'s support for the Fed chairman.     Baker is understood"" to have played a key role in Volcker\'s reappointment to the Fed in" mid-1983.     The sources said Baker respects Volcker and when appointed Treasury Secretary in February 1985, he decided to ensure a good working relationship, in part because he believed the two key government economic institutions have to work closely.     Regan, T"reasury Secretary during President Reagan\'s first term, was formerl""y head of Wall Street\'s largest brokerage firm Merrill Lynch and ca""me to Washington determined to be America\'s pre-eminent economic sp"okesman.     He developed a deep antipathy for Volcker, whose political skills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets took much more seriously.     But the sources said Volcker would have to be invited to stay. "Is the president going to ask him? he wouldn\\\'t stay otherwise," said one. "He\\\'d have to be asked," said Stephen Axilrod, formerly staff director of monetary policy at the Fed and now vice-chairman of Nikko Securities Co. International.     Otherwise, the list of potential candidates is not awe-inspiring. And if Volcker left this Augsut, he would leave behind one of the most inexperienced Fed Boards in years.     Many analysts believe this lack of collective experience -- the four sitting members were all appointed within the last three years -- is dangerous, coming at a time when the global economy is threatened by instability.     An experienced successor, therefore, would seem a necessity. One widely mentioned possibility is Secretary of State George Shultz, whose experience as Treasury Secretary under Preesident Nixon and background as a trained economist would make him ideal.     But Shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-Iran scandal, while vice-chairman Manuel Johnson is regarded at 37 years old as too young for the job.     Other potential candidates include economist Alan Greenspan, frequently an informal presidential economic adviser, New York Fed President E. Gerald Corrigan, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp chairman William Seidman, and Sprinkel.     Long a Regan protege", Sprinkel\'s chances may be damaged by his patron\'s departure from "the White House.  Reuter \\x03'

S'General Motors Corp has changed its method of disbursing merit raises for salaried employees and is reducing the size of the merit raise pool to 3.5 pct of the total amount available for salaries from 5.5 pct last year, a company spokesman said.     He said GM will no longer include merit raises in the calculation of base pay but will make them simply lump-sum payments.  As a result, the merit raises will not be included in the calculation of pensions and other benefits.  The change affects about 109,000 salaried workers in the U.S. and Canada.                                             GM last year eliminated cost of living increases for salaried workers, making pay increases based on merit alone. As a result of the new action, GM has effectively frozen the base pay rates of salaried employees.     The spokesman said GM is making the change to remain cost-competitive with other U.S. automakers.     GM is currently in thje midst of a program to cut employment of salaried workers by 25 pct.

S'Pre-Paid Legal Services Inc said it has signed a letter of intent under which it would receive financing from I.C.H. Corp.     The company said under the proposed transaction I.C.H. would loan it up to 100 mln dlrs, and the loan balance would be convertible at any time by either party into Pre-Paid common stock at 11 dlrs per share.  In addition, it said it would grant I.C.H. a five-year option to purchase new shares at the same price.  It said the option would enable I.C.H. to acquire up to 500 pct plus one share of Pre-Paid common.     Pre-Paid said until expiration of the option, and as long as Pre-Paid maintained a mutually agreeable combined loss and expen"se ratio, I.C.H. would, on Pre-Paid\'s request, exercise as much of ""the option as may be necessary to meet Pre-Paid\'s funding needs.  "   The company said I.C.H. has requested the right to buy 90,909 Pre-Paid shares from Pre-Paid chairman Harland C. Stoneciphjer for 11 dlrs each.  Stonecipher now owns or has the right to acquire 1,965,269 Pre-Paid shares and will agree to restrictions on the sale of his remaining shares, it said. The company saiod Stonecipher will remain chairman.     Pre-Paid said the transactions are subject to approval by boards of both comnpanies and regulatory agencies.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Employers and the port union, FNV, are to meet again this afternoon" to attempt a settlement of the six-week-old dispute in Rotterdam\'s" general cargo sector, but neither side is optimistic, spokesmen for both sides told Reuters.     Little progress was made in last ni"ght\'s three hours of talks, with both sides largely reiterating the"ir positions.     "There is still a very large gap between the empl"oyers and the FNV, and I can\'t say that we expect to reach any agre"ement. But at least we are still talking," a union spokesman said.     Employers organization chairman, Jacques Schoufour, accused the FNV of intransigence in refusing to alter its stance at all over the past two months.     "The FNV is not serious about our discussions and I am really not optimistic about it changing its point of view at all."     "If we find this afternoon that the FNV still refuses to accept the necessary redundancies in the general cargo sector, then we will break off the talks and the redundancies may begin later this month," Schoufour said.     The series of strikes, which employers say has cost them more than seven mln guilders in lost import business in the past six weeks, began on January 19 in protes"t at plans for 800 redundancies from the sector\'s 4,000 workforce s"tarting with 350 this year.     Late last month Social Affairs minister Louw de Graaf said unless the dispute was settled by yesterda"y he would withdraw the sector\'s 10 mln guilder annual labour subsi"dy.     Both sides wrote to the minister yesterday setting out their cases, but Schoufour said he did not expect to hear from him before Wednesday at the earliest.  Reuter \\x03'

S'The Unilever Plc and NV <UN.A> group saw improved performance in almost all sectors during 1986, the Anglo-Dutch group said in its results statement.     Very good progress was made last year, while th"e recent acquisition of Chesebrough-Pond\'s Inc <CBM.N> was a signif"icant addition which will greatly benefit the group in the years to come.     Earlier, Unilever reported combined fourth quarter pre-tax profit of 276 mln stg, level with the year earlier period, making 1.14 billion stg compared with 953 mln for the 1986 full year.     Unilever said it plans to change its depreciation policy to the more conventional practice of depreciating assets individually rather than depreciating fixed assets at average rates. The new method is expected to lead to a reduction in the accumulated provision for depreciation and thereby increase the net book value of tangible asssets by about 300 mln stg as at January 1, 1987.     Unilever Plc shares are up 25p since yesterday at 2,575p in buoyant response to the results and share split proposal, though 1986 profits were not ahead of market forecasts, dealers added.

S'The U.S. index of leading indicators fell a seasonally adjusted 1.0 pct in January after a revised 2.3 pct December gain, the Commerce Department said.     The department previously said the index rose 2.1 pct in December.     The decline in January was the biggest for any month since July, 1984, when the index fell 1.7 pct.     The January decrease left the index at 183.8 over its 1967 base of 100, and was led by a fall in contracts and orders for plant and equipment.     A total of six of 10 indicators available for January contributed to the decline.     Besides contracts and orders for pla"nt and equipment, they were building permits, manufacturers\' new or"ders for consumer goods, a change in sensitive materials prices, slower deliveries from vendors and higher average weekly claims for state unemployment insurance.     Four of 10 indicators were positive, including stock prices, new business formation, average work week and money supply.     The main factor for the December upward revision was new business formation.     There was no revision in the 0.9 pct increase in the leading indicators index for November.     The index of coincident indicators, which measures the current economy, fell 0.1 pct in January after increases of 0.7 pct in December and 0.2 pct in November.     The index of lagging indicators, which measures past economic activity, rose 0.5 pct in January after a decrease of 0.5 pct in December and an increase of 0.2 pct in November.  Reuter \\x03'

S'"This morning\'s sharp decline in coffee prices, following the breakd"own late last night of negotiations in London to reintroduce International Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, will be short-lived, Dutch roasters said.     "The fall is a technical and emotional reaction to the failure to agree on reintroduction of ICO export quotas, but it will not be long before reality reasserts itself and prices rise again," a spokesman for one of the major Dutch roasters said.     "The fact is that while there are ample supplies of coffee available at present, there is a shortage of quality," he said.     "Average prices fell to around 110 cents a lb following the news of the breakdown but we expect them to move back again to around 120 cents within a few weeks," the roaster added.     Dutch Coffee Roaster"s\' Association secretary Jan de Vries said although the roasters we"re disappointed at the failure of consumer and producer ICO representatives to agree on quota reintroduction, it was equally important that quotas be reallocated on a more equitable basis.     "There is no absolute need for quotas at this moment because the market is well balanced and we must not lose this opportunity to renegotiate the coffee agreement," he said.     "There is still a lot of work to be done on a number of clauses of the International Coffee Agreement and we would not welcome quota reintroduction until we have a complete renegotiation," de Vries added.     With this in mind, and with Dutch roasters claiming to have fairly good forward cover, the buying strategy for the foreseeable future would probably be to buy coffee on a hand-to-mouth basis and on a sliding scale when market prices were below 120 cents a lb, roasters said.

S'"AMR Corp\'s American Airlines said it will buy 40 long-range jet air"craft to support international expansion, including routes in the Caribbean.     Under one agreement, the airline said, it will acquire 15 Boeing Co <BA> 767-300 planes. Under a separate agreement, American will acquire A-300-600 aircraft from <Airbus Industrie>, a E"uropean consortium.     The company\'s announcement included no valu"e for the order.     Published reports put the value of the aircraft order, including engines, at 2.5 billion dlrs.     A total of 98 General Electric Co <GE> CF6-80C2 engines is involved in the orders, American Airlines said.     The published reports valued the engines at five mln dlrs each.     The company said it will acquire the planes and engines using rental leases that can be terminated on relatively short notice.     The arrangement allows the airline to acquire the planes without adding to its debt, it explained.     The Boeing 767s, to be delivered from February 1988 to October 1988, will be used on routes between the U.S. and Europe, American said.     It said the Airbus A300s, scheduled for delivery from April 1988 through June 1989, will be assigned to the Caribbean, where American has developed a major new hub at San Juan, Puerto Rico.

S'"H.J. Heinz <HNZ.N> chairman Tony O\'Reilly would be interested in bu""ying Guinness PLC <GUIN.L>\'s brewery division if it were for sale, "a spokesman said.     The spokesman, reacting to Irish and British press reports, said "He continues to be interested were the group to offer the brewery side of Guinness for sale. But he has not put together a consortium, nor has he been buying shares."     He was quoted by the Irish magazine Business and Finance as saying he would be interested if it came on the market and that he had the support of two international banks if he decided such a purchase might be worthwhile.     In the magazine article, he suggested that if brewing profits were calculated to be in the region of 80 mln punts, the asking price would not be higher than 800 mln punts.     "A multiple of ten times earnings would be the top whack for the brewing division in the current Guinness situation," he said.     "This would mean an expensive exercise, right on the edge, but not impossible," he added.     The deal would mean buying the Dublin, London, Nigerian and Malaysian breweries because "It could only be sold as an integral unit if it was going to be sold at all," O\\\'Reilly said.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Equatorial Communications Co said it expects to report losses of about 57 mln dlrs for the fourth quarter and 68 mln dlrs for the full year 1986 on revenues of about 10 mln dlrs for the quarter and 52 mln dlrs for the year.     Equatorial said the losses will include a charge of about 45 mln dlrs from costs associated with the restructuring of its business, including adjustments to reflect the market value of transponders owned and leased by Equatorial and other reserves for inventory, receivables and excess facilities.     Equatorial said the fourth quarter operating results will also include restructuring costs of about 5,500,000 dlrs, in addition to the 45 mln dlr charge.     Equitorial also said that as of March One it is operating in technical default under its lease of transponders on the Galaxy III satellite due to its inabiliuty to maintain agreed-upon financial ratios.  It said it is in talks with the lessors in an attempt to restructure lease obligations.     Further, Equitorial said it is in default of two other oblitations in connection with the purchase or lease of transponders as a result of cross-default provisions.     Equatorial said it has signed a memorandum of understanding for Contel Corp <CTC> to purchase 10 mln dlrs of Equatorial master earth stations, micro earth stations and associated equipment and loan Equatorial six mln dlrs over a six-month period for repayment starting in December 1988.     The company said Conteol, "under the agreement, would assume a portion of Equatorial\'s rights "and obligations under the Galaxy III transponder lease with <Burnham Leasing> on the occurrence of certain events.     Equatorial said it would grant Contel an option to buy about 3,600,000 common shares at 3.25 dlrs each.     Equatorial said its understandings with "Contel are subject to Equatorial\'s ability to restructure a signifi"cant portion of its obligations and to obtain concessions from lenders and lessors, in particular under its Galaxy III transponder lease. It said it hopes to finalize a Contel agreement by April 15.     Equatorial in 1985 earned 1,807,000 dlrs after a 3,197,000 dlr gain from early debt retirement on revenues of 56.1 mln dlrs. For the first nine months of 1986, the company lost 9,476,000 dlrs on revenues of 45.4 mln dlrs, compared with a 1,784,000 dlr profit after the early retirement gain on revenues of 38.5 mln dlrs.

S'<BP Oil Ltd>, the U.K. Marketing and refining arm of British Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L>, raised its pretax operating profit on a replacement cost basis to 182 mln stg in calendar 1986, compared with 66 mln stg in 1985.     Sales and operating revenue fell to 3.1 billion stg from 4.2 billion on a replacement cost basis. Historical cost operating profit was 61 mln stg, up from 16 mln.     BP Oil said 1985 profits had been depressed by exceptional items. Its profit figures were stated before interest charges.     Chief executive David Kendall said improved results mirrored benefits of a restructuring program undertaken in recent years.     However, he warned future financial pressure on the industry will be severe.     "The U.K. Oil marketing and refining industry will need to invest larger sums - probably around 500 mln stg a year - for a good many years," he said in a statement.  Reuter \\x03'

S'Earthquakes and aftershocks are still shaking areas of northern New" Zealand following yesterday\'s strong tremor which left 3,000 peopl"e homeless.     Four earthquakes measuring up to 4.5 on the Richter scale have hit the Bay of Plenty and Waikato region in the north-east since midnight yesterday (1200 GMT).     No casualties have been reported and no further major damage, civil defence sources said.     A government seismologist said from Rotorua in the North Island some five tremors were being recorded every 10 minutes.     The seismologist said if the pattern of other large earthquakes was followed the shocks would continue for one to several weeks, declining in frequency and magnitude. But the chance of a further large shock could not be ruled out.  Reuter \\x03'

S'The U.S. Wants Japan to eliminate import controls on agricultural products within three years, visiting U.S. Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen Wallis told Eishiro Saito, Chairman of the Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren), a spokesman for Keidanren said.     The spokesman quoted Wallis as saying drastic measures would be needed to stave off protectionist legislation by Congress.     Wallis, who is attending a sub-cabinet-level bilateral trade meeting, made the remark yesterday in talks with Saito.     Wallis was quoted as saying the Reagan Administration wants Japanese cooperation so the White House can ensure any U.S. Trade bill is a moderate one, rather than containing retaliatory measures or antagonising any particular country.     He was also quoted as saying the U.S. Would be pleased were Japan to halve restrictions on agricultural imports within five years if the country cannot cope with abolition within three, the spokesman said.     Japan currently restricts imports of 22 agricultural products. A ban on rice import"s triggered recent U.S. Complaints about Japan\'s agricultural polic"y.  Reuter \\x03'
